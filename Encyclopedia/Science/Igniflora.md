*Pyroflorus Vulgaris*

***Appearance***: a botanical marvel, appears as a miniature bonfire in bloom. Its luminescent orbs, pulsating with vibrant crimson hues, delicately hover above a sinewy, obsidian stem. Unlike traditional petals, its structure consists of translucent, flame-like tendrils that sway gently in an unseen breeze, casting dancing shadows nearby.

***Description:*** Igniflora blooms in extreme heat, often found in volcanic regions or near sources of intense fire magic. Despite its fiery appearance, its tendrils remain cool to the touch, making it resistant to the scorching temperatures of its environment. The flower releases a faint, sweet scent reminiscent of smouldering embers.

***Common Uses:*** The rare nectar produced by the Igniflora is a crucial ingredient in alchemical recipes for creating heat-resistant potions, flame-retardant coatings, and even enchanted items that provide protection against fire-based attacks. Additionally, its petals are sometimes used in rituals and ceremonies to invoke the element of fire or as decorative accents in magical gardens.
