The Consort is the goddess of people, emotion and society including all social constructs. The followers of this deity are fractious but united in the aspects of its teachings: love, forgiveness and unity. These followers are often progressive and inclusive, but some sects are known to be suffocating, oppressive and stalker-like. Some believe that the Consort is a false front for the deity's original malevolent form. Known to appear most commonly in festivals and large gatherings, the Consort uses these events to garner favour among the populace.

## Depiction.
The deity herself is depicted as a voluptuous woman with vibrantly coloured skin ranging from pinks to purples and blues, always dressed in the latest fashion unique to the area. Her beauty and charm are captivating, and she has a way of making even the most sceptical of believers feel at ease in her presence.
