#wasteland #T2-3

# Before the Fall
Keford was a bright and bustling city, filled with magical innovations where traders, mages and inventors shared their new creations daily. The Demiplane Spheres scattered about the city created a number of safe spaces for these new inventions to be tested in a safe environment. A unique technology created, perfected and only found within Keford. Inventions ranged from daily living improvements, new restoratives and weapons of war were tested here. The techniques of demiplanes and magical energy control were perfected here, creating a unique study of magic known as "Leycadence".

# After the Fall
The Kefordian Crater is a barren wasteland of the once proud and bright city of Keford. The sun dappled city streets once vibrant are now husks, empty and vacant, brought to ruin by The Device. While only a third of the land is taken by the physical crater left by The Device, the wastes surrounding it is colloquially referred to as The Crater. 

The destruction of the Device to Keford would not have been so extensive, were it not for the amplification caused by the rupturing of numerous demiplane spheres setting off a chain reaction of planar tears all across Keford's city bounds.

Now the ground is a tapestry of cracked earth and twisted metal, remnants of the ancient city's downfall. Whirlwinds of sand and ash twist and dance across the wasteland. Fiery storms ignite from nowhere, their flames casting a sickly light over the surrounding ruins before dissipating into the acrid air.

While the bones of Keford can be seen, the further from the epicentre, this barren wasteland becomes more prominent the closer to the actual crater left by The Device. 
## General Features 
The Crater is a vast wasteland with the very magic itself, twisting and writhing in agony, from the effects of the device. 

***Flight***. Some intelligent creatures have learned the ability to ride the magical currents to gain limited flight. Creatures with an intelligence of 10 or higher have a flight speed of feet equal to 3 times their INT score. 

***Ethereal tears***. Rupturing of the ley lines and pulling of the magical energies from the ethereal plane have caused tears in the local planes within the Crater. Creatures attempting to enter the ethereal plane or teleport within the irradiated zone immediately fail and take 8d10 force damage. 

***Wild Magic***. The disruption of ley lines has caused magic to be somewhat unpredictable. When casting a spell of first level or higher, roll a D20. On a 15 or higher, roll on the Wild magic table. 

***Magical Disturbances.*** The Kefordian Wasteland is riddled with chaotic ley lines and unpredictable arcane phenomena, resulting in mana vortexes, arcane storms, and reality tears. These disturbances cause spells to behave erratically, create temporal rifts, and generate dangerous magical entities and anomalies throughout the scarred landscape.

## POIs

### The Shattered Marketplace
Once the bustling heart of Keford, the marketplace is now a haunting reminder of the past. Stalls and buildings lie in ruins, covered in ash and debris. The area is eerily quiet, with the occasional gust of wind stirring up clouds of dust and ash. 

***Hidden Treasures:*** Among the ruins, advanced materials and some magical items can be found. However, they are often hidden under rubble or guarded by traps left by former inhabitants.
	**Example Materials and Items**
	 - *Weather Control Rod:* Produce a minor localised weather effect such as rain or wind affecting up to a 5 foot cube.
	 - *Ether Stone:* A once common crystal only made in Keford that harnesses and contains magical energy proportional to the crystal's size. To this day, not even Litoria has been able to reproduce these stones. 
	 - *Arcanite Alloy:* A unique metal found only in Keford. Said to hold enchantments more easily than common metals and rivals the quality of Rockhold's dwarven metal.

**Ghostly Echoes:** The marketplace is haunted by the spectral remnants of its former vendors and shoppers. These spirits are not malevolent but can provide cryptic warnings or information about the past. 

### The Aural Cove

The Aural Cove is a partially collapsed amphitheatre located near the heart of the former city of Keford. Once a grand venue for public speeches, debates, and performances, it now stands as a haunting reminder of the city's cultured past. The amphitheatre's hemispheric structure is mostly intact, but the seating and stage are littered with rubble and overgrown with strange, glowing fungi that thrive on the residual magic.

 ***Echoing Voices.*** The amphitheatre still retains its incredible acoustics, and sounds made within it are amplified and can be heard clearly throughout the structure. However, these echoes often carry snippets of conversations from the past, seemingly replaying the last moments before the catastrophe.
   
***Spectral Figures.*** During certain times of the day or night, a ghostly figure of a former citizen may appear, watching an invisible performance, putting on a show, or passionately debating a non-existent counterpart. These spirits are non-aggressive but emit a sense of sorrow and loss.

**Secret Chambers**: Beneath the stage lies a series of hidden chambers that once stored important documents, scripts, and magical artifacts. The entrance is hidden and requires a successful Investigation check (DC 14) to locate.
These chambers are protected by ancient arcane traps designed to deter intruders. Disarming them requires a successful Arcana or Thieves' Tools check (DC 16). 
	**Example Artifacts:**
	 - *Sonic Amplifier:* a small cylinder that can amplify or direct sound waves. Can increase volume of sound directed into it, or increase damage dealt by Thunder attacks.
	 - *Presenter:* A small attunable cube that can cast the spell *silent image* at will. The image lasts up to 10 minutes without concentration and can move.
	 - *Harmonic Adjutant:* a unique form made of arcanite alloy that allows the user to create any atmosphere and also was often used to tune instruments within seconds. It also doubles as a tuning fork for almost any plane of existence. 

### The Ruins of Keford Collegiate

#### Description
The Ruins of Keford Collegiate, once a beacon of arcane knowledge and intellectual pursuit, now lie in desolation and decay. This sprawling complex housed separate divisions for each school of magic and was renowned across Landercoast as the premier institute for arcane studies. Within its hallowed halls resided the Vault of the Archmagi, the greatest repository of knowledge in all of Landercoast. The collegiate specialized in archiving all human-collected knowledge from the Cape of Landercoast, and its loss is felt deeply by scholars and mages alike.

Now, in the aftermath of The Device’s catastrophic activation, the collegiate is a haunting shell of its former self, a testament to the immense power and peril of unchecked magical energy.

#### Features

1. **Shattered Halls**:
   - **Collapsed Structures**: The grand buildings that once housed the various schools of magic are now partially collapsed, their walls cracked and roofs caved in. Debris is scattered across the courtyards, and many of the structures are overgrown with strange, luminescent fungi.
   - **Arcane Residue**: The air within the collegiate is thick with the residual magic of countless spells cast within its walls. This lingering energy causes unpredictable magical effects, and spellcasters must be wary of casting spells here (roll on the Wild Magic table when casting spells).

2. **Vault of the Archmagi**:
   - **Hidden Entrance**: The entrance to the Vault of the Archmagi is buried under rubble and protected by powerful wards that have survived the devastation. Finding and accessing the vault requires solving complex arcane puzzles and deciphering protective runes.
   - **Magical Defenses**: Despite the destruction, the vault's defenses remain active. Intruders face arcane traps and animated guardians designed to protect the vault's contents. These defenses react to any unauthorized attempts to enter the vault.

3. **Haunted Classrooms**:
   - **Ethereal Professors**: The spirits of former professors still linger in the classrooms, eternally lecturing to phantom students. These ethereal figures are non-hostile but can provide cryptic insights or warnings to those who listen.
   - **Arcane Echoes**: The classrooms occasionally replay scenes from the past, showing moments of instruction or significant events. These echoes can be disturbing and disorienting to observers.

4. **The Convergence Hall**:
   - **Fractured Nexus**: The central hall where the different schools of magic converged is now a chaotic nexus of unstable magical energy. The convergence of multiple ley lines here has created a zone of intense arcane turbulence.
   - **Temporal Anomalies**: Time flows erratically within the Convergence Hall. Characters might experience time slips, where they see visions of the past or future, or feel time moving faster or slower than normal.

5. **The Library of Tomes**:
   - **Damaged Archives**: The vast library, once filled with shelves of meticulously cataloged tomes, is now in disarray. Many books are damaged or missing, and the remaining ones are scattered across the floor.
   - **Living Texts**: Some of the books have been infused with the chaotic magic of the Collegiate and have become semi-sentient. They move about the library, and retrieving specific texts requires chasing them down or convincing them to cooperate.

#### Encounter Hook
The party is drawn to the Ruins of Keford Collegiate by a quest to recover a specific tome from the Vault of the Archmagi. This tome is said to contain crucial information about the nature of The Device and a potential way to mitigate its lingering effects on the region.

### The Fallen Ward Gate

#### Description
The Fallen Ward Gate, once a monumental testament to Keford’s grandeur and security, now stands as a colossal relic of a bygone era. Towering over 80 feet tall, this immense gate was the sole entry and exit into Keford proper. Crafted from intricately forged metal and adorned with arcane runes, the gate was a symbol of the city’s strength and technological prowess. It took over 150 of the elite Kefordian city guard, known as the Wardens, to open at sunrise and close at sundown each day, ensuring the city's safety and regulating the flow of commerce and visitors.

Now, in the aftermath of The Device’s devastating activation, the gate lies in a state of disrepair, a haunting monument to the city’s tragic downfall.

#### Features

1. **Ruined Majesty**:
   - **Scarred Structure**: The gate, once resplendent, is now marred by deep cracks and scorched by magical energy. The intricate carvings and runes have been partially obliterated, yet their ghostly outlines remain, hinting at their former brilliance.
   - **Bent and Twisted**: Sections of the massive metal doors are bent and twisted, as if torn by a giant's hand. Debris from the gate and the surrounding wall litters the ground, creating an obstacle course of jagged metal and stone.

2. **Residual Magic**:
   - **Arcane Echoes**: The air around the gate hums with residual magic. Occasionally, flickers of arcane light dance across the surface of the metal, casting eerie shadows and illuminating the damage in brief, ghostly flashes.
   - **Unstable Energy**: The gate's enchantments, though disrupted, still hold a semblance of power. Proximity to the gate can cause magical items to behave unpredictably, and spellcasters may feel a tug on their arcane abilities, making control difficult (roll on the Wild Magic table when casting spells near the gate).

3. **Guardians of the Past**:
   - **Warden Phantasms**: The spirits of the Wardens who once operated the gate now linger as phantasms, bound to their duty even in death. These spectral figures, clad in tattered remnants of their armor, patrol the area. They are non-hostile unless provoked, and they silently watch any who approach the gate.
   - **Spectral Vigilance**: Interaction with these phantasms requires delicate diplomacy. They can offer cryptic warnings or insights into the city’s history and the events leading up to the cataclysm.

4. **Echoes of Entry**:
   - **Faint Whispers**: Those who stand near the gate can hear faint whispers on the wind, echoes of conversations and orders given long ago. These whispers are a mix of mundane instructions and desperate last words, creating an unsettling atmosphere.
   - **Phantom Footsteps**: At times, the sound of ghostly footsteps can be heard, as if the Wardens were still performing their duties, opening and closing the gate at the prescribed times.

#### Encounter Hook
The party is drawn to the Fallen Ward Gate by rumors of a hidden vault beneath its foundation, said to contain valuable artifacts and records of Keford’s most guarded secrets. To access the vault, they must decipher the remnants of the gate's enchantments and gain the trust or permission of the lingering Warden phantasms.

**Challenges**:
- Navigating the treacherous debris and unstable magical energies surrounding the gate.
- Communicating with the Warden phantasms and interpreting their cryptic messages.
- Solving the puzzle of the arcane runes to unlock the entrance to the hidden vault.

**Potential Rewards**:
- Access to ancient artifacts and valuable historical records.
- Insights into the secrets of Keford’s fall and the true nature of The Device.
