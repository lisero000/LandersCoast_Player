*Small #Town, demonym: " #Fronterran / #Fronterite"*

The town of frontier is a bustling hub of Guild activity. Adventurers prepare to depart as a last stop before entering the Jade Forest proper.

The town itself is a disorganised cluster of supply shops, inns and taverns as well as a lumber mill owned by the guild to supply its timber.

Frontier is run by the local margrave: Wilson Tiddlespark, a gnomish tinkerer turned entrepreneur. Wilson is a business savvy individual who once ran with an adventuring party and because of this he has carefully created a town with just the right shops for adventurers. Wilson regularly visits every store in Frontier to ensure that their stock is best suited for adventurers and keeps them in line.
