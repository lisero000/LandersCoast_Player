When the Device was activated, not only did it level the city of Keford but it caused effects that could be felt across Landers' Coast and beyond.

Winds picked up the irradiated magical energy to the west and turned what was once a simple hilly range near [[Camor]], melted the crust and the resulting pressure created a sudden range of mountains, including a now active volcano known as Cinderplume Peak.

Adventurers, geologists and magical scholars regularly visit the Ashgrove to investigate the natural effects that The Device has caused on Temos. The earth around the range has been bored to a near cheese-like structure as people descend further into the crust. As they do, not only do they contend with the heat and pressure of Temos' crust, but they also discover more dangerous denizens the further down they descend. Along with this, adventurers are hired to protect these individuals and to provide new challenges.

# Ecology

The combination of twisted leyline energies and elemental abundance has turned the Ashgrove into a haven for fire elementals, ember serpents and many other monstrous fire creatures. These creatures regularly spill in to the surrounding area, causing havoc for nearby travellers.

The Ashgrove is filled with creatures twisted into its fire motif from Cinderplume Peak. Cave Bats permanently set ablaze from the energy now cause swarms of Firebats to unintentionally migrate across the Cape. Motes of Flame infused with magical energy become flame elementals. The chaos of which causes madness in their limited sentience, enraging them to swell into a full-fledged fire elemental.

Rumours exist among many seemingly desperate and adventurous traders of the potential crossing to the Elemental Plane of Fire as fire giants have been seen scouting or otherwise stranded in the depths of the tunnels beneath.

> [!note]- Embera, the Radiant Wanderer
> 
> Embera, a friendly fire elemental, resides in the Ashgrove, drawn to the area due to the surging magical energies and the presence of other fire creatures. Unlike its monstrous counterparts, Embera has retained its benevolent nature and seeks to maintain harmony between the elemental inhabitants and the surrounding towns.
> 
> Embera's presence in the Ashgrove brings several potential benefits when interacted with:
> 
> 1. Elemental Knowledge: Embera possesses deep understanding of fire magic and elemental forces. It can provide valuable insights and teachings to those seeking to enhance their mastery of fire-based abilities or learn about the elemental realm.
> 2. Elemental Favor: As a respected figure among the fire creatures in the Ashgrove, Embera can act as a mediator or intermediary, helping to establish peaceful interactions between nearby towns and the elemental inhabitants. This can lead to alliances, trade agreements, or even assistance during times of need.
> 3. Elemental Guardians: Embera can call upon the aid of lesser fire elementals and ember serpents to protect nearby towns and settlements from more aggressive fire creatures. These elemental guardians can provide enhanced security and defense against potential threats.
> 4. Fire-Attuned Artifacts: Embera may possess knowledge of hidden locations or ancient artifacts within the Ashgrove that are imbued with fire magic. These artifacts can grant unique abilities or serve as powerful tools for adventurers who prove themselves worthy.
> 
> However, it is important to note that Embera's presence in the Ashgrove is delicately balanced. Disturbing this balance or acting with ill intent towards the fire creatures may result in hostility or the resurgence of aggression among the elemental inhabitants. It is in the best interest of adventurers to approach Embera with respect and a willingness to preserve the peace within the region.
# Points of Interest

## Base Camp

This permanently makeshift collection of tents on the South-western range based on a small crater is filled with traders, adventurers and other individuals preparing for their respective journeys ahead.

The traders here are quick to make their gold pieces on last minute preparations from Flasks of Fire Resistance to cold-enchanted weaponry. Many will try to call on the convenience of the location however, such a well known-fact leads to a fiercely competitive market. Buyers here have the majority of the balance of bargaining power here.

Some adventuring parties outside of the Fold use this as a means to complete some side-work whilst gaining valuable adventuring experience. As a result, mercenaries, hirelings and freelance adventurers use this as a great opportunity to be hired as extra muscle (or fodder).

## The Ash Barrow

The single, interconnected and natural cave system made from the creation of the Ashgrove is known as the Ash Barrow.Â  Here the majority of the cave systems were twisted from the magics and magma, creating a writhing, complicated tunnel system as a perfect introduction to new adventurers to the Ashgrove's themes. Many of the creatures here are either changed from their natural forms or are weakened due to their distant proximity from the worst ley-line fissures. Most of the items found here are from fallen adventurers who misunderestimated the Barrow's hidden challenges or those spoiled by familial inheritances to be properly trained.

## Cinderplume Castle

The blackstone and obsidian castle found at the highest peak of the Cinderplume is thought to have been created by a long lost adventuring guild but has since changed hands multitudes of times. Now its true ownership is a mystery to all but the most seasoned adventurers. Adventurers keen to discover the identity of this owner are first confronted with the Blackstone Bridge, followed by a rigorous climb to the peak of the Cinderplume. Even then, various guardians defend the halls of the castle all the way to its tallest spire. Some believe this castle to be owned by a retired Balor who had escaped the Nine Hells. Others believe that it belongs to one of the oldest and most benevolent Gold Dragons searching for a successor.
