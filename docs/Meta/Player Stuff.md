## Intro
First founded by Gregory Landers in an event celebrated as “Founders’ Day and expanded into the five major cities Keyford, Litoria, Mewood, Camor, and Rockhold Keep. Each of these cities have given their unique history, culture, and struggles to shape the land. 

- **Keyford**: The Sprawling City spans well across the Farnhallow Plains for miles with its expansive farmland contracting into the city’s intricate roadways. New generations of human noble families run the city following the destruction of the original Keford, seeking to learn from the mistakes of the past guided by The Accord.

- **Litoria**: The Port City, is steeped in tradition and lineage, tracing its roots to an old half-elven ancestor or an immigrant dragonborn. Nestled in the eastern coast, the three Quorra: Quorum of the Voice, Sword and Coin each provide an important overarching aspect of governance within the city in a constant flux of power.

- **Mewood**: A once proud elven city, struggles under the subjugation of the recent Litorian authority. The once breath-taking city dismantled to a shadow of its former glory, maintaining a fraction of its historical beauty within its city centre.

- **Camor**: A city built from necessity, is home to misfits, refugees, and The Fold, a heroes’ guild that creates and nurtures heroes both great and terrible. Survivors from the fall of Keford, Litorian deserters, Mewood refugees and most recently, Rockhold aspirants assimilate under the charismatic musings of Henry Amew, the fourth descendant of the city’s original founder.

## The Annexation of Mewood

Along with the destruction of the city of Keford, the recent annexation of the city of Mewood is a cause for extensive debate for everyone within Landers' Coast. Reactions extend well into a spectrum between abhorrence to motivated support toward the move.

The complexities of the city's annexation are profound. While a lot of the Mewoodan elvish culture has been infected or assimilated (depending on your perspective) there are both significant objectively beneficial and detrimental changes as a result.

> The disease Feybane devastated the elven population in [[Mewood]] until Aradwyn Solthiel intervened, developing a potent vaccine that neutralised its magical properties and bolstered natural defences. Feybane, an airborne pathogen with high infectiveness, caused severe fatigue, fever, and respiratory distress, particularly affecting elves due to their magical affinity and unique physiology. Despite initial struggles, Aradwyn's innovative solution marked a turning point, curbing the disease's spread and instilling hope within the community.

## Magical Innovation

Some argue that the city of Mewood was stagnating in the presence of magical progression across Landers' Coast. As a result, magical innovations such as a unique blend of spellcasting now found only in Mewood have arisen known as "Harmonatic Arcanism". Other elvish and Litorian magisters have began to come together to incorporate Litorian artificer techniques to produce a number of 'magitech' items and systems such as the 'Harmonatic Nexus', a system of synthesised crystals linked by the roots of the trees to create a local magical network of leylines within the city. These leylines power a number of other systems such as the automation of the city's lighting, removing the need for the guards to light the magical lighting around the city. These innovations have come with their own challenges, however native Mewoodans protest the use of Harmonatic Arcanism claiming a perversion of the natural divine magics given by the gods. Challenges of the Harmonatic Nexus reached a peak when a local resonatic hub overloaded near the Aurora Conservatory, causing a nearby home to vanish. There are unsubstantiated rumours countering this stating that both the house was empty at the time and the hub was sabotaged by a group known as the Eclipse Vanguard, a group antithetic to Mewood's annexation.

## Economic Golden Age

In addition, denizens of the new Mewood now live in a significant economic golden age, where trade of both import and export have begun to flourish. Mewoodan citizens have gained access to a number of new experiences from Keyfordian Dreamcatchers, Rockholder Iron Ale to a devoted Camorian embassy including a satellite branch to [[The Fold]]. It is no debate that both Mewoodans and Landers' Coast denizens understood the class warfare prevalent within Mewood by some families of the old Verdant Protectorate. A number of philanthropic ventures have been undertaken by Litorian organisations underneath the banner of the Quorum of the Voice. One of the most successful of these ventures is the "Mewoodan Healthcare Initiative". This initiative, led by the Concordia Collective has improved the preventative aspect of healthcare within Mewood. The initiative also gave rise to the most efficacious vaccine against Feybane, a rampant disease that has caused many issues within Mewood. Despite these significant positive impacts to Mewood, the golden age has provided new challenges that are causing native Mewoodans to be unprepared for their significant effects. Dreamcatchers and Iron Ale have given rise to a number of darker groups of individuals exploiting both native Mewoodans and expatriate Litorians in creating this new vice. As a result, a number of slum areas have begun to arise, with the new Sylvan Steward incapable of handling these new internal threats. Meanwhile, the Concordia Collective has been under pressure by many activists and natives for withholding vaccines to native Litorians declining the registration of a Litorian identity.

### The Activation of The Device

The destruction of the old city of Keford is an event etched into the collective memory of the denizens of Landers’ Coast. It was a tragedy born from a bitter feud between two influential houses within the city, a conflict that escalated to an unprecedented level with the activation of a powerful magical artefact known only as “The Device.”

Keford was a thriving city, a centre of commerce, culture, and magic. But beneath its bustling surface, tensions simmered. Rivalries between noble houses were common, but none as fierce as the enmity between House Veritas and House Mordain. Over years, their feud festered, leading to acts of sabotage, betrayal, and open conflict. 

The culmination of this feud was catastrophic. Historians and magical academics believe that The Device, a bomb of unimaginable power, was created in secret by one of the houses. Designed to absorb ambient magic and draw energy from the immediate ethereal plane, The Device’s very construction was an act of hubris.

On that fateful day, the leaders of House Veritas and House Mordain stood at the brink of mutual destruction. In a desperate, final bid to end the feud, The Device was activated. Its destructive power was beyond comprehension. In an instant, much of Keford was annihilated, its population obliterated, and its lands reduced to a smouldering ruin.

The aftermath was devastating. The explosion created what is now known as [[The Kefordian Crater]], a vast, corrupted scar on the landscape. The magical ley line that once nourished the city was permanently tainted, rendering the area inhospitable. The crater is now haunted by magical monstrosities and the restless spirits of the victims, a constant reminder of the catastrophe.

The fall of Keford sent shockwaves throughout the peninsula of Landers' Coast. The destruction of such a significant city disrupted trade routes, severed supply lines, and left a void in the region’s economy. The political balance shifted dramatically, with the mercantile city of Litoria rising in prominence amid the chaos. The peaceful elves of Mewood found themselves subjugated as the power dynamics of the region were upended.

The loss of life, economic turmoil, political instability, and environmental devastation marked the beginning of a new era. The calendar itself was reset, designating the years after the fall as ‘FK’ – After Keford.

Today, the Kefordian Crater stands as a testament to the perils of unchecked power and the fragility of peace. The recreation of such a device has been banned by divine decree, a solemn vow to prevent history from repeating itself. Yet, the lessons of Keford continue to shape the destiny of Landers’ Coast, a reminder of the past's dark shadow and the enduring hope for a brighter future.

The fall of Keford was a turning point, a tragic chapter in the history of Landers’ Coast. Its echoes are felt even today, as the region strives to rebuild and remember, to honour the past while forging a path forward.
