# Brief
The Fold is the renowned heroes' guild founded in the city of [[Camor]] with the mission to produce heroes, nurture their strength, and protect society.

The Fold's banner reflects the essence of the guild and its goals. The banner's white background symbolizes the "City of Opportunity" where the guild was founded. Camor has always been a thriving city that provided endless opportunities for those who sought them. The black vertical bar on the banner represents a "fold," from which the guild's name derives. The Fold seeks to unite different individuals under one banner, with each person contributing to the fold to make it stronger.

The yellow semi-hex shape in the center of the banner represents the guild's goal to produce heroes, nurture their strength protect society. The semi-hex shape is made up of four points. The yellow semi-hex shape in the center of the banner represents the guild's goal of protection, made up of four points that represent physical, mental, spiritual, and emotional protection.

The red triangle above the yellow semi-hex represents the guild's willingness to take on challenges and threats to society, going beyond reactive measures to proactively address threats and keep society safe.

The Fold is an inclusive heroes' guild that welcomes members of any morality, as long as they work with and are friendly to the guild. The guild believes that individuals should be judged by their actions and character rather than their morality, and therefore, the guild is open to all individuals who share their common goal of serving society.

The guild provides extensive training and resources to help members become the best versions of themselves, and offers a sense of community and belonging to all members. The guild values diversity and understands the importance of having a supportive and inclusive environment to achieve their mission of protecting society.

## Quest Cards

The Fold uses a series of quest cards that are available to the public for a small fee. These cards can be taken from one of The Fold's designated vendors or directly from the guild itself.

The quest cards may range from simple tasks such as delivering a package or protecting a merchant caravan, to more complex missions such as retrieving a stolen artifact or slaying a powerful monster.

Requestors who may be aynone from an individual, an organisation or even one of Landers' Coast's cities donate to The Fold to request a quest card are not guaranteed that their request will be fulfilled. However, the cards are made available to The Fold's network of heroes, who are free to choose which missions they undertake.

There are concerns about the use of quest cards by some as a means of outsourcing dangerous or morally dubious missions to the public. Others note that the system could be abused by individuals seeking to take advantage of The Fold's resources for personal gain. The guild thoroughly vets quest cards only to ensure that they are not destructive to the The Fold.
# Target Designation

- **Friendly**: These are individuals or creatures that pose no threat to the guild or its members. Members are encouraged to be friendly and courteous in their interactions with them.
