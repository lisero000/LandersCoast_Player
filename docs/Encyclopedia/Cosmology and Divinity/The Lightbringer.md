The Lightbringer is the god of life, the suns and colloquially, food. His followers protect and believe in the sanctity of life and symbolise it with fire and the colour white. The Lightbringer often seeks the pious such as clerics or paladins but has been known to mete out his favour to any proving themselves devout to the protection of life. There are those however who are overzealous and just, invoking the Lightbringer's name to partake in ludicrous crusades. Rumours suggest that the Lifebringer holds a name known only to the other gods, long lost by mortal minds to time. However, the Lightbringer makes regular appearances in the farms around Keyford.

## Depiction
A masculine humanoid towering just under the height of a cloud giant with glistening marbled skin, a white flame atop their head, wielding an ornate golden spear is most reliably seen in the farms on the Solar Triclipse to mark the period of harvest.

## Customs:

Â The Lightbringer's followers observe a prayer or attend a sermon before the following times to revere their deity:

- Before a meal (prayer)
- Starting the day on the farm (prayer)
- The start of the season (mass)
- Before any feasting (prayer)

The most common taboo of the Lightbringer is the waste or rejection of food. The gifts of nature are deemed to be sacrosanct to the followers of the Lightbringer and this is reflected in many of the deity's families.

The Lightbringer also prohibits excessive retribution. The priests of the Lightbringer proclaim that justice is to be delivered with a measured approach and that one is never to seek aggravation or incite harm without dutiful and just cause. Many of the laws in Litoria and Landers' Coast often use this wording in law making and judicial decisions.

Lastly, the most devout followers, be they priests or citizenry alike, promote a goal of "helpfulness to a fault". These followers embellish the deity's tenet of protection to the weak and many have been killed in the act of martyrdom to protect an individual they believed to be innocent. Rationalists cry out to temper this fervour however martyrdom still accounts for a large chunk of deaths of the followers of the Lightbringer.

*Rejecting acts of healing or refusing assistance to those in need:* As a god of life, the Lightbringer encourages the protection and preservation of life. Refusing to provide aid, whether physical or emotional, to those who are suffering or in need of healing could be seen as disrespecting the deity's principles

*Exploiting natural resources without regard for sustainability:* The Lightbringer is associated with nature. Engaging in reckless exploitation of natural resources, such as deforestation or polluting water sources, without considering the long-term consequences or sustainability would be considered blasphemous.
