**She/her**
**Status:** alive, not worshipped, banished
**Domains:** twilight, peace, nature

While [[The Lightbringer]] watches over the flourishing crops and the 'worked' elements of nature, the followers of Lunara toil tirelessly in secrecy, devoted to restoring the land to its pristine glory before the dark descent of Eshendal.

Unlike many deities in Temos, Lunara has been cast aside from mainstream worship, shunned by civilizations that consider most Banished deities to be inherently evil. Even many druidic societies often ostracize followers of the Skyfire, believing them to be tainted by association.

However, a little-known truth remains concealed from most inhabitants of Temos: Lunara's banishment was a voluntary act, driven by reasons known only to her closest disciples.

Lunara presides over the tranquil darkness and the serenity that pervades the world whilst it slumbers. Whispers of her ethereal presence circulate among hunters and wanderers, suggesting that she frequents serene groves illuminated by the moon's gentle glow. Witnessing the awe-inspiring Skyfire herself is believed to either bring great fortune or foretell a dreadful omen, its significance a matter of conjecture and interpretation.

## Depiction

While the rumours of her depiction are steeped in speculation, a number of commonalities arise in the stories of lovestruck hunters and wanderers. Lunara appears as a feminine, elvish figure with slender, pale skin tinged with the blue light of the moon. She is draped in a luxurious silk robe falling to the ground along with her gossamer silvery hair.
