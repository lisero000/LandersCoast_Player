The Usurper is a well known deity of the winding caverns, subterfuge and blood. Within the winding caverns and shadowy depths, the influence of Wormweaver extends, weaving a tapestry of subterfuge, bloodshed, and dark secrets. As the Usurper, Wormweaver has not only claimed dominion over the domain of spiders following the reported death of the goddess of spiders but has also seized control of the realms of insects, blood, and plagues.

Cults devoted to the Usurper revere the power of blood, recognizing it as a source of both life and death, and as a conduit through which one can tap into the dark forces lurking beneath the surface. They perform rituals, sacrifices, and rites involving blood, embracing the macabre and the forbidden. The Usurper's followers believe in the inherent power found in the depths, in the secrets whispered by the crawling creatures that dwell below.

The Undead nature of Wormweaver adds to the aura of dread and mystery surrounding this dark deity. As an embodiment of death and trickery, Wormweaver holds sway over the shadowed realms and unseen passages, guiding their cultists with whispered promises and veiled secrets. The Usurper's followers revel in the enigmatic nature of their patron, embracing the art of deception and manipulation as tools to further their own nefarious agendas.

Legends of Wormweaver infiltrate the imaginations of uncooperative children, whispered tales that speak of sinister writhing and slithering noises emanating from beneath their beds, foretelling the Usurper's intent to snatch them away in the dead of night. This deep-rooted fear persists into adulthood, intertwining with a sense of guilt that becomes inexorably linked to the very name of the deity.

The stories woven around Wormweaver's name are designed to evoke shivers down one's spine, to stoke the flames of anxiety, and to instil a sense of trepidation when darkness falls. The deity's reputation for cunning subterfuge, blood rituals, and manipulation becomes the source of countless nightmares, haunting the dreams of both the innocent and the guilty.

## Depicition
None have ever truly beheld the visage of Wormweaver, but whispers and chilling tales abound of a shadowy figure draped in a tattered cloak, its cowl obscuring its features in perpetual darkness. Fingers of writhing dread are said to snatch away unsuspecting souls, while beneath the depths of that hood lies a visage devoid of humanity, consumed by serpentine worms, their malevolence emanating from a pair of haunting, luminescent eyes.
