The Forgemaster is the god of craft, creation and honour. Devoted to the dwarves within Rockhold, Thuranm is one of the most benevolent deities within Landers' Coast. Despite this and his strong motivation to protect Rockhold from the evil that dwells beneath the stone, his presence is rarely felt leading to a slow decline from the minds of his devotees. Followers of the Forgemaster show diligence, honour and a strong sense of duty.

## Depiction

Thuranm, The Forgemaster, stands tall and proud with broad shoulders and a muscular build. His beard is long and thick, made of pure molten gold that shines with an otherworldly glow. He wears a suit of armour made of the finest metals, a testament to his mastery of the forge.

As the god of craft and creation, he holds a hammer in one hand and a pair of tongs in the other, both glowing with the heat of the forge. His eyes are piercing and seem to look straight into the soul of his followers, inspiring them to be diligent in their work and honour their commitments.
