Eshendal, known as The Landsire, is a deity associated with the untamed forces of nature, the cycle of life, and the brutality of war. However, their worship and presence have been banished and suppressed due to their corrupt and malevolent nature. The followers of Eshendal form secretive cults operating in the shadows, driven by their devotion to the deity's dark influence.

Some believe Eshendal to once be the godess of nature, a position now taken by the Skyfire. Eshendal is believed to have fallen from their grace, overwhelmed by the incessant nature of the darkness. Believing that chaos is the true natural order, Eshendal seeks to twist nature into a realm of decay and chaos. The deity's corrupting touch can be felt in the withering of plants, the sickness that befalls creatures, and the unleashing of destructive forces in times of conflict.
 
## Depiction
Eshendal's once feminine beauty has been disfigured in to part-humanoid, part-beast. Their form is grotesque, with gnarled limbs, decaying flesh, and eyes radiating a malevolent dark purple energy. Others have rumoured that Eshendal takes on a twisted, illusory version of their previous form: a dark purple and vined feminine visage reminiscent of a dryad's beauty with withered leaves and decayed flora encompassing his form.
