The gods in Temos play a vital and direct role in its destiny. Some claim them to be ascended mortals while others believe that they are deific beings from distant worlds. One certain commonality among these beings however, is that their strength is directly correlated to the fervour of their followers. Most gods are either ambivalent or benevolent to mortals however some are actively antithetical to them. Those that promote chaos and death, however, are rarely worshipped, losing their power and being considered "Forgotten". This has resulted in the current Pantheon to be mostly consistent with the former, more friendly gods by virtue of power. The exception to this are "The Banished", a collection of darker entities subsistent on their own fanatical cults.Â

## Table of Deities
***Status***: *Alive/Dead/Undead*: If alive or undead, the deity exists and can be found. If dead, the deity cannot be found (easily).

***Worshipped/Not Worshipped/Cult***: Worshipped deities have structures and rituals openly found and practised by individuals upon the material plane. Deities Not Worshipped could be banned, or simply do not have common rituals practised and structures found in the material plane. Some individuals may profess their faith in their own unique way, however there would be no clear indicators. Cults are worshipped but strictly prohibited among the civilised races

***Known/Unknown/Banished***: Known deities have been witnessed within the material plane and are well established. Unknown entities such as Death and some of the deities lost to the Shadowfell have an unknown fate. They may still exist or no longer exist in an identifiable form. This is different from if the deity is alive as both a live or dead deity could still exist in another realm or form.

- Bahamut and Tiamat had reconciled and left only dragons wishing isolation or seek to claim their place.
- Tharizdun now acts on a higher plane, challenger of the greater deity of [[Death (Deity)]].

# Alternate Sources of Worship
When a deity is not openly worshiped, they may source power from "followers" from one of the potential sources below:We sh

1. **Indirect Influence**: The deity might influence people indirectly, through concepts, ideologies, or values associated with them. For instance, if the deity represents an abstract concept like knowledge, curiosity, or justice, people engaging in activities aligned with these principles could unconsciously provide power to the deity.

2. **Unconscious Worship**: People might venerate the deity without realising it, through practices or rituals that have lost their original meaning over time but are still imbued with the deity's essence. For example, certain cultural traditions, sayings, or customs might originate from the deity's worship, continuing to fuel their power.

3. **Forgotten or Hidden Cults**: The deity may have followers who practice in secret or have been forgotten by history. These followers could maintain a low profile, practising rituals or offering prayers in private. The deity might also have a presence in secluded or remote areas, where their worship continues unnoticed by the wider world.

4. **Divine Residue**: The deity could draw power from residual energies left from past worship. If they were once widely worshipped, the lingering belief or reverence might still provide them with a baseline level of power.

5. **Non-human Worship**: The deity could receive worship from non-human beings, such as spirits, elementals, or even intelligent creatures like certain animals or magical beings. These entities might not form traditional cults but still provide reverence in their own way.

6. **Internal Strength**: In some cases, a deity might have an intrinsic source of power that doesn't rely entirely on external worship. This could be tied to their nature, domain, or a unique characteristic that sets them apart from other deities.

7. **Intermediary Channels**: The deity might empower individuals unknowingly, through dreams, inspiration, or guidance, leading them to actions or creations that align with the deity's domain. This indirect influence could serve as a form of worship, channelling power back to the deity.

8. **Symbiotic Relationships**: The deity might have established a symbiotic relationship with another entity or force. This could be another deity, a powerful magical artefact, or a natural phenomenon. Through this relationship, the deity gains power, perhaps by maintaining the balance of a natural cycle or through a mutual exchange of energies.

9. **Mythic Legacy**: The deity's strength could be sustained by the stories, myths, and legends that persist about them. Even if they are not actively worshipped, the mere act of telling their stories, singing songs, or recounting tales of their deeds keeps their presence alive and provides them with power.

10. **Artefacts and Relics**: The deity may have imbued artefacts, relics, or sacred sites with their power. Devotees, adventurers, or even unwitting individuals interacting with these items or places might unknowingly provide the deity with strength, either through the use of the artefacts or by experiencing epiphanies and revelations at these sites.

11. **Divine Sparks in Mortals**: The deity could invest small portions of their essence into chosen mortals, granting them minor divine powers or inspiration. These individuals, whether they know it or not, act as living conduits of the deity's influence, and their actions and faith can provide energy back to the deity.

12. **Alignment with Natural Laws**: The deity's existence and power might be tied to the natural order or cosmic laws, such as the seasons, the tides, or the cycle of life and death. As long as these natural phenomena continue, the deity remains sustained, drawing power from the inherent balance and rhythm of the universe.

13. **Dreamscapes and Astral Worship**: The deity could exist within the dreamscapes or astral realms, where they receive power from the dreams, thoughts, or subconscious desires of mortals. Even if the mortals are unaware, their dreams and astral projections might form a kind of worship that sustains the deity.

14. **Destiny and Fate**: The deity might be tied to the concept of destiny or fate. They draw strength from the unfolding of events and the fulfilment of destinies, especially if they play a subtle role in guiding these outcomes. Individuals fulfilling their destinies, particularly in ways that align with the deity's nature, could provide a form of worship.

15. **Existential Concepts**: The deity could represent a fundamental existential concept, such as chaos, order, entropy, or creation. These forces are ever-present and eternal, allowing the deity to draw power simply from their existence and the continuous play of these forces in the world.
