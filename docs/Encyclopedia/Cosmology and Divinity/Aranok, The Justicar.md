Aranok, known as The Justicar, is a deity associated with the pursuit of order and justice, but their methods and true intentions are shrouded in darkness and manipulation. Aranok has risen to power by taking the place of the old Lord of the Nine Hells, ascending to a position of authority and influence in the realms of punishment and judgment.

The followers of Aranok form a secretive cult that reveres the deity as the ultimate arbiter of law and order. They believe in the necessity of conflict and war to establish a rigid hierarchy and enforce their vision of justice. However, their actions often lead to widespread suffering and oppression under the guise of maintaining order and peace.

Aranok's worshipers see themselves as agents of divine retribution, carrying out the deity's will through acts of ruthless enforcement and punishment. They interpret peace as the absence of resistance and discord, rather than the presence of harmony and understanding. The cult's hierarchy mirrors the hierarchical structure of the Nine Hells, with different levels of devotees enacting Aranok's will with fanatical zeal.

Aranok's first act as the world's Justicar sent shockwaves through the divine realms, as it marked the unexpected and brutal slaying of the old Serpentine god, who was on the cusp of attaining an apotheotic redemption granted by the other benevolent deities. Seeing it as a threat to the established order and the delicate equilibrium of the divine hierarchy, Aranok took it upon himself to ensure that chaos would not find a foothold in the divine realms.

While often determined as a pessimistic portent, Aranok is most often found within judicial systems and courts of law, especially those known for their strict adherence to order and punishment. These courts, most recently found in the courts of Litoria within the Quorum of the Sword are believed to be cursed against defendants and have been reputed to be nothing more than formalities for sentencing.

## Depicition 
Aranok is depicted as a regal figure, clad in armor with clean cuts and angular lines, radiating an aura of authority. Their countenance is stern and uncompromising, exuding an air of absolute certainty in their convictions. The Justicar is often portrayed with a sword emanating a dark, firey energy matching that of the Nine Hells. However, few have dared to see the Justicar within the Material Plane not just for the risk of being judged but also much of the work within the Nine Hells remains incomplete following the departure of the previous Lord.
