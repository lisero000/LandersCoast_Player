The Conqueror is another one of the fallen deities within Temos similar to Eshendal. In a display of immense strength, Zerekiel murdered two of the ancient evil gods in a flurry of tempestuous power, claiming the destruction of "great evils" within Temos.

The other benevolent deities were apalled at this murder and attempted to forcefully banish Zerekiel. Wounding even the great Lightbringer in a battle that took place in many planes of existence, Zerekiel retreated to the depths of the oceans of Temos. Stories of this great battle filled the minds of diviners and deific speakers and clerics of all temples and eventually reached the ears of commonfolk. Soon cults quickly rose sympathetic to the now named "Conqueror", claiming injustice at his 'banishment'.

The remaining gods and pious individuals across Temos still haven't determined the extent to which Zerekiel's murders has affected the world and a consensus still lacks to this day. Some warriors pray to Zerekiel before battle for victory and rumours abound that he can still be heard, roaring in anger in the wide expanse of the seas. Because fo this, Zerekiel is now viewed as the god of tempests, storms, the wide ocean and battle itself.

## Depicition
Within visions in temples from the battle, Zerekiel is viewed as an incredibly muscular gargantuan figure clad in leathers and wielding a large serrated single-edged greatsword that crackles with thunderous energy. Stories are told that when the sky thunders, it is Zerekiel swinging his weapon beneath the waves, practicing for his next and possibly final bout.
