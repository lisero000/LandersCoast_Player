The entity known only as "Death" is a mysterious and enigmatic deity. It is said to be made up of many individual beings, each one representing a different aspect of death, from the gentle embrace of passing on to the terrifying force of sudden, violent death.

It is considered taboo across Landers' Coast to speak openly of one's devotion to the god of death out of respect for the role it plays. Instead, people pay their respects to Death through small offerings left at gravesites, the lighting of candles, or by observing a moment of silence.

Despite being feared and respected by many, Death is also known for its benevolent and compassionate nature. It is said that Death takes great care to guide souls to their final resting place, ensuring that they are at peace and that their loved ones are comforted in their passing.

Death can be seen anywhere and at any time, but it is most often encountered in places associated with death and the afterlife, such as graveyards, crypts, and catacombs. It is also said to be most active during the twilight hours, when the veil between the living and the dead is at its thinnest.

## Depiction: 
Death is often depicted as a cloaked figure in purple, shrouded in shadows and wreathed in an aura of darkness. Its face is rarely seen, and when it is, it is often described as a skull-like visage, cold and unfeeling. The colour purple has is deeply associated with power, royalty, and nobility, in Landers' Coast and as the master of death and the afterlife, the deity Death is considered to have ultimate power and authority over all mortal beings.
