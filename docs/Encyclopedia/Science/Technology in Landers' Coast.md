title: "Technology in Landers' Coast"
---

Magic and technology over the years in Landers' Coast have led to countless inventions and innovations on the use of magic. Most built up areas have magic fill in most conveniences from magical lights, porters offering short range transport services to heating and cooling solutions. With this new frontier of magic, the Coast struggles to keep up. Portal abductions are a far too common crime and reputation as a portal user is everything. The recent and expensive Scrying stones are garnering demand on shady Street coners and illusionists combine wit and charm with sleight of hand to catch unsuspecting victims.

While most unscrupulous individuals are quickly rooted out, criminal organisations such as the Duskclaws clash with groups intent on providing more benevolent arcane services. The largest legitimate organisation being the Mirchenzo family based in Litoria, with ties to communications, transport and minor magical artefacts.

Rooms known as "Dreamcatchers" have also become popular in the years since the fall of Old Keford. Multi purpose rooms facilitated by illusionists to mimick certain environments and experiences. Adventurers from spelunkers to bodyguards seek to train their skills within these rooms while civilians and the general populace mostly utilise these rooms for entertainment. The cheapest of these rooms are run by low level magicians, offering only a handful of experiences whilst others, especially those who charge the highest prices employ multiple illusionists, sometimes with one for each type of sense. It is rumoured that within the city of Litoria, a street known as "Dreamlight Valley" is filled with exploitive, more adventurous Dreamcatchers.

In Landers' Coast, there are a variety of magical portals that people use to have their shopping delivered right to their doorstep. These portals are typically connected to a network of portals located in major cities and trading hubs throughout the region.

These portals are maintained by the group of transport specialised wizards known as the "Porters". These wizards are highly respected across every city in Landers' Coast and currently hold a monopoly in portal logistics. Vendors often sell single-use sending stones along with printed inventories of requested supported shops for buyers to take home. Upon requesting the delivery, the sending stone is consumed and the order is fulfilled by the vendor to be given to the Porters for transportation.
