The world of Temos is a planet with regular seasons and a wide variety of climes, ranging from frigid ice caps to arid deserts, temperate forests, windswept plains, sweltering jungles, and storm-tossed oceans. It orbits a pair of white dwarf suns, and is orbited by a single moon. Distant stars twinkle in the evening skies and a recently revised calendar was created by the Quorum of the Voice following the fall of Keford and a number of celestial discoveries are only thanks to the Università di Litoria. The founding of Landers’ Coast is no longer denoted as the time period but is still celebrated on the final day of Winter at the end of the sixth month.

In the celestial mechanics of Temos, Argentra, the moon, follows an orbit influenced not by one, but two white dwarf suns, named Solara and Lumina. These suns’ gravitational interplay with Temos and its moon creates a complex pattern of alignments, making lunar eclipses more frequent as the moon passes through the varied shadows cast by each sun. These eclipses are particularly influenced by the magical leylines crisscrossing Temos, which are thought to amplify celestial events due to their arcane properties.

The eclipse cycle on Temos, known as the **Serapho Cycle**, is named after the renowned Litorian astronomer **Serapho Caelumtore**. Given the presence of two suns, this cycle suggests a pattern where eclipses might occur when Argentra aligns with either sun and the planet, leading to eclipses being more frequent and predictable.

This translates into a d20 die roll to determine the occurrence of a lunar eclipse during any full moon. Given the increased frequency of potential alignments, on a roll of 11-20, a lunar eclipse will occur.
