**Overview:** _Arcanist's Gambit_ is a thrilling casino dice game unique to Keyford that combines elements of chance with a touch of strategic spell casting. Players wager on the outcomes of dice rolls and use "spell cards" to influence those outcomes or disrupt the rolls of their opponents.

**How to Play:**

- **Components:**
    
    - 3 six-sided dice (standard pips 1-6, coloured red, blue, and green for thematic purposes).
    - Spell cards: Each player receives two random spell cards at the beginning of the game.
- **Setup:**
    
    - Players place their bets on a large table marked with different sections for each type of bet (similar to a Roulette table).
    - Bets can be placed on specific dice outcomes (e.g., all dice show even numbers), sums of the dice (e.g., sum ranges like 10-12), or special combinations (e.g., three of a kind).
- **Gameplay:**
    
    1. **Betting Phase:** Players place their bets on the marked sections of the table.
    2. **Rolling Phase:** The dealer rolls the three dice.
    3. **Spell Phase:** Players may use one spell card to alter the roll results or affect other players' bets. Spells include:
        - **Freeze Spell:** Locks a die on its current number.
        - **Double Trouble:** Doubles the payout if the player's bet wins.
        - **Elemental Shift:** Changes one die’s outcome to any number.
        - **Guardian’s Luck:** Rerolls any number of dice once.
    4. **Resolution Phase:** Bets are resolved. Successful bets based on single dice results pay 5:1, sums or combinations have varying payouts, and special features pay up to 10:1 depending on difficulty and rarity of the outcome.
- **Winning Conditions:**
    
    - Players win by correctly predicting the outcome of the dice rolls, either through direct bets, strategic use of spell cards, or a combination of both.

**Strategy:** The strategic use of spell cards can significantly influence the game's outcome. Players must decide whether to use their spells to enhance their own chances, block an opponent, or wait for a more advantageous moment.

**Example Game Flow:**
