title: "Keyfordian Culture"
---

In the fabric of Keyfordian culture, the threads of past calamities and present triumphs interweave to create a society rich with unique customs, beliefs, and traditions.

## Linguistic Nuances

When conversing in the common tongue, which might sound like accented English to an outsider, the melodic intonations and rhythmic cadences could hint at a society accustomed to diplomatic discourse and scholarly debate, reflecting their values of education and eloquence.

Keyfordian speech is characterised by a melodic cadence and a clear, deliberate pronunciation that reflects their deep-rooted values of clarity and direct communication. This is manifest in the way they emphasise the start and end of each word, which can make their speech pattern sound somewhat staccato to outsiders. Their accent involves a softening of hard consonants common in English, such as 't' or 'd', turning them into softer sounds more akin to 'th' or a light 'd'. This gives a smoother and more fluid sound to their speech, making it distinct from the sharper pronunciations of standard Common.
### Unique Word Choices in English

Keyfordians would prefer terms that reflect their meticulous nature and preference for formal language:
- **"Gather"** instead of "meet up"
- **"Commence"** instead of "start" or "begin"
- **"Forthwith"** instead of "immediately"
- **"Whilst"** instead of "while"
- **"Upon"** instead of "on" (e.g., "I will see you upon the morrow.")
### Sentence Structure Changes
Keyfordians might avoid contractions in their speech, reflecting their formal and thoughtful communication style. For example:
- "I am" instead of "I'm"
- "It is" instead of "It's"
- "We will" instead of "We'll"
This extends to their writing, which often features longer, more complex sentences that fully elaborate thoughts rather than relying on the implicit understanding of shorthand phrases.
### Keyfordian Unique Words

In their own language, reminiscent of Medieval English/Dutch/Germanic, Keyfordians might use terms like:
- **"Glimmerlicht"** (from German "Glimmer" and "Licht," meaning shimmer light): Used to describe the first or last light of the day, a metaphor for hope or ending.
- **"Steenhart"** (from Dutch "steen" and "hart," meaning stone heart): Used to describe someone very resilient or emotionally guarded.
- **"Waldweard"** (from Old English "weard," meaning guardian, and "wald," forest): A term for a ranger or guardian of the woods.
- **"Huiskeep"** (from Dutch "huis" and English "keep," meaning home fortress): Used to describe a household or family estate.
### Keyfordian Idioms in English

- **"Like mending a road in the rain"**: Used to describe a futile or overly difficult task, originating from their emphasis on infrastructure and the difficulties of maintaining it during adverse conditions.
- **"To carry one's bricks"**: Meaning to take responsibility for one's actions or duties, reflecting the importance of personal accountability in their culture.
- **"Building a bridge from both banks"**: Used to describe efforts to meet halfway in negotiations or relationships, stemming from their values of cooperation and mutual understanding.
## Norms and Behaviours

A Keyfordian’s day is often marked by communal interactions that emphasise their value of unity and cooperation. For instance, shared meals in large halls or open markets are common, where individuals from different houses and backgrounds come together, symbolising the society's foundation on communal strength and support.

In the public squares, it is a common sight to see individuals engaged in impassioned yet respectful debate, a nod to their democratic values and the importance placed on every voice being heard. This might be reminiscent of the agora in ancient societies, where public discourse was encouraged and valued. 

Because of this, each individual Keyfordian has a finger on the pulse of the city's political landscape and politics is seen as a common talking point. Each Keyfordian can remember the names of almost every prominent house from before and after the fall, and is a point of learning in most primary and secondary educational institutions.

## Values and Ethics

The Accord represents more than a governing body; it's the embodiment of Keyfordian ethics. Justice is not a concept to be enforced solely by the powerful; it is a communal responsibility, where the rule of law is upheld by common consent rather than by coercion. This is evident in the way the Keyford Militia operates — not as an imposing force, but as a collective of individuals who serve by merit and shared conviction.

The Keyfordian work ethic is steeped in a cautious respect for tradition over novelty. The expansive farms and carefully maintained roadways are monuments to a society that values sustained labour and reliable craftsmanship as guardians against the unforeseen dangers of unchecked innovation. In this society, wary of another calamity like The Device, every road mender plays a crucial role, their diligent hands reinforcing the stability and continuity of Keyfordian life, weaving together the strands of the present with the time-honoured threads of the past.

## Cultural Feature: The Remembrance

Just a dozen years on from The Device's shadow, "The Remembrance" is a raw and vivid ceremony in Keyford, deeply woven into the fabric of the present. This annual observance is less about the distant past and more a collective moment of reflection, with the city still nursing its wounds. It’s a time when the stories told are not yet sealed into the realm of myth but are recounted by those who bore witness, their voices lending immediacy to the narrative. The event serves not just to remember but to reaffirm the community's bond, a solemn testament to resilience, and an acknowledgment of the path towards recovery that lies ahead. This day is a sombre reminder of fragility and strength, a point of unity where Keyfordians look back with reverence and forward with cautious hope.

During "The Remembrance," the focus is on revering the old ways. Artificers and magicians may present their crafts, but they do so to honour traditional methods that have stood the test of time, shying away from the unpredictable nature of new enchantments. The subdued glow of mundane, non-magical lanterns and the time-honoured symbols that adorn the cityscape during the festival are not just for ambiance; they represent a Keyfordian commitment to the proven and the safe, illuminating a collective hope rooted deeply in the wisdom of the past.

## Cultural Examples
#### Mindful Creation

In the shadow of past destruction, Keyfordian crafters approach their work with a philosophy of mindful creation. Objects are crafted not in haste, but with deliberation and respect for the materials and methods of old. Most crafters in Keyfordians are known for their slow, deliberate turnaround times. This is often to the detriment of newer, inexperienced crafters who haven't produced anything to warrant the extended production times. However, Keyfordian goods are known for their reliability and quality.

#### Daily Reflection

Keyfordians have woven into their day a moment of quiet reflection, often observed at the setting of the sun, where they pause for a minute from whatever they’re doing to remember those lost. This moment is both a personal and public act, shared silently among citizens in marketplaces or in the middle of a busy thoroughfare, a collective breath that honours the past and steels them for the future. Keyford itself signifies this hour with a single, unified ringing of bells across the city. 

#### Communal Dining

The tradition of communal dining extends beyond family meals into the workplace, where colleagues gather to share food during breaks, reinforcing bonds and bridging social hierarchies. This practice fosters a sense of togetherness, reminiscent of the solidarity needed in the wake of The Device's devastation. Family meals are often across a large table and it would be common to find multiple homes pushing outdoor tables together to eat communally.

#### Open Councils

Political participation is ingrained in the daily life of a Keyfordian, with open councils held in every district where citizens can voice concerns and opinions. These forums are akin to the town hall meetings of old but are a daily event rather than an occasional one, highlighting the value placed on the collective voice and the shared responsibility of governance.

See [[Keyfordian Council|here]] for running an encounter in the council.

#### Wearable Reminders

Every Keyfordian can remember something or someone from their Kefordian counterparts. Most families in Keyford now have heirlooms within their homes that are revered fondly. Criminals have even been known to strip a house, leaving only these tokens as a sign of honour despite their illegal acts. These heirlooms are not just decorative but are part of their identity, often touched or glanced at during decision-making, as if seeking wisdom from ancestors.

#### Artisan Markets

Marketplaces in Keyford operate with a strict policy against the sale of untested magical items, with inspectors who vet each product for safety and adherence to traditional practices. This ensures that the pursuit of progress does not overshadow the lessons learned from their history.

Through these daily customs, Keyfordians have crafted a way of life that celebrates their heritage and honours the memory of those they've lost, always with an eye on safeguarding their future.

## Example Names
Each Keyfordian's name is a story within itself from before The Device. As a result, the surname may describe the family from before and after The Device in a unique compound word. First names may be optimistic, "Hope" is a common name for female Keyfordian babies after The Device. "Bastion Forgedawn," where "Bastion" conveys a steadfast, protective nature, a common trait admired in post-Device society, while "Forgedawn" encapsulates the family's transformation from smiths into an era of renewal and optimism. In certain situations, where an individual isn't part of a ruling or prominent house, they may simply have a first name only.
