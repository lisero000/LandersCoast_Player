### Coat of Arms
1. **Shape of Shield**: A classic heraldic shield shape, broad at the top and tapering to a point at the bottom.
2. **Main Colours**: The primary colour of the shield would be a rich gold, symbolizing wealth, prestige, and the family’s longstanding influence. This would be contrasted with bands of white across the shield, aligning with the colours of their guard uniforms.
3. **Central Symbol**: At the center of the shield, a large, stylized oak tree with deep roots and expansive branches, painted in a dark green to stand out against the gold background. This symbolizes the family’s deep roots in the region and their expansive reach in politics and society.
4. **Secondary Symbols**: Flanking the tree, two lions rampant, one on either side, in a bold black outline. The lions represent courage and strength, reflecting the family’s role as protectors and leaders within their community.
5. **Banner Below the Shield**: A scroll beneath the shield carries the family motto in black lettering. The motto could be something like “Firm in Duty”, reflecting their commitment to leadership and service.
6. **Border Detail**: The edge of the shield could have a detailed border in alternating segments of black and gold, adding a touch of elegance and formality to the crest.

### Brief
The Wellingtons are one of the oldest houses within Keyford and stand for tradition, propriety and order. They hold significant influence with many merchant guilds within the city and are considered the first thought in property. The Wellingtons have already absorbed three nearby districts from collapsed houses and nearing a fourth through a series of complex trade deals with the other houses. Their near infallible success result in large contributions to the Accord fund which have funded hundreds of public works projects within the city. Because of this, many of the more radically conservative values of the house are given a subtle hand wave

### History of the Wellingtons

At the turn of the century, a lowly tax collector named Isiah Welynton witnessed a pivotal event that pushed him to action: a devastating famine that ravaged the land for years. During this famine, the nobles, continued to hoard their wealth and resources, while common folk like his neighbours, the Hreeks, starved. One harrowing day, Isiah discovered the desiccated corpse of Thomas Hreeks, his longtime friend and neighbour, unceremoniously thrown in front of the Hreek household. With the anguished wails of Thomas's family as a backdrop, Isiah confronted the nobleman responsible and learned that Thomas had been punished for overdue taxes, amounting to 1,000 gold pieces—nearly triple the previous demand.


Over the next decade, Isiah's efforts transformed Keyford's entire taxation system and created a network of altruistic like-minded individuals to ensure the integrity and fairness of the Kefords tax system. 

Isiah began with his closest potential ally: Lord Harland, whom he collected taxes for. Isiah skimmed small amounts of taxes from his collections to create a fund for his future endeavours. Using this money, he greased the palms of Harland's competitors in a patient game to take his place. 

Within a year, Harland was assassinated by one of his competitors and upon his dying breath, Isiah took his place, claiming the name "Wellington" as a testament to his rise. 

Isiah used his new found power and allies to improve the lives of many that now sat under his sway. He was loved by the common folk and fell in love with Madeira Hreeks, the widow of Thomas. Together they raised countless families out of prosperity within Harland's old fiefdom and the land prospered. 

His old allies however laid claim to the favours owed to them from assisting against Harland. Isiah was captured and Madeira was raped and killed. He was captive to the nobles for nearly two weeks with barely any water and the food he could scavenge from the scraps thrown at him within his cell. Eventually he was released by the countless commoners who he had helped, forming a mob that would eventually place him back into power. This mob was trained and in return, Isiah created Keford's first trained militia. 

The militia laid claim to a large swath of land across Keford and the Wellington name became renowned for its generosity.

The militia laid claim to a large swath of land across Keford, and the Wellington name became renowned for its generosity. 

### The Rise of House Wellington

Generations passed, and the Wellington family continued to grow in power and influence. The initial militia formed by Isiah became a respected military force, and the family's holdings expanded through strategic marriages and alliances. The Wellington name became synonymous with generosity and justice, but also with shrewdness and power.

**The Generations that Followed:**

- **The Early Wellington Lords:**
  - Following Isiah's death, his son, Marcus Wellington, took over. Marcus was known for his strategic mind and his ability to navigate the treacherous waters of nobility. He expanded the family's holdings and cemented their place in Keford’s political landscape. Under his leadership, the Wellingtons built schools, hospitals, and public works that benefited the common folk, but also reinforced their own power.

- **The Middle Era:**
  - As the centuries passed, the Wellingtons adapted to the changing times. They became patrons of the arts and sciences, supporting innovations that improved the lives of their subjects. The family's wealth grew, and they became known for their opulent lifestyle and strict adherence to tradition. Generosity became a tool for maintaining power, as the Wellingtons ensured that their benevolence was always tied to loyalty and service.

- **The Age of Expansion:**
  - During this era, the Wellingtons expanded their influence beyond Keford, establishing trade routes and political alliances that brought prosperity to their lands. They built grand estates and fortified their holdings, creating a legacy of strength and stability. The family's adherence to order and tradition became even more pronounced, with strict codes of conduct and elaborate ceremonies reinforcing their noble status.

### The Modern Era and the Fall of Keford

Twelve years ago, the old city of Keford was destroyed in a catastrophic event known as the Fall of Keford. This event, caused by a magical artefact known as "The Device," decimated the city and left the surrounding area permanently corrupted. The Wellingtons, like many other noble families, were deeply affected by this tragedy.

**[[Lord Eiling Wellington]]’s Rise:**
- **Current Head of House Wellington:**
  - Lord Eiling Wellington, the current head of the family, has worked tirelessly to maintain the family's legacy of order and tradition. Eiling, who was found shortly after the fall of Keford, embodies the values of old money and stability that the family has cultivated for centuries. Under his leadership, the Wellingtons have focused on rebuilding and maintaining their influence in Keyford and beyond.

- **Preserving the Legacy:**
  - Eiling has been instrumental in preserving the Wellington family’s values and traditions. He has funded numerous public works projects, supported the arts, and maintained the family's strict adherence to order. His formal attire, deliberate gestures, and commanding presence are a testament to the family’s long-standing commitment to tradition.

- **Family Dynamics:**
  - The Wellington family today includes Eiling’s wife, Lady Siaculas, a woman with her own dark ambitions, and their children, Eulus and Felix. Each member of the family plays a role in maintaining the family's legacy, with Eulus focusing on innovation and Felix pursuing martial excellence.

### Transition to the Present

From Isiah’s humble beginnings as a tax collector to the current era under Lord Eiling’s leadership, the Wellington family has transformed from a symbol of rebellion and justice to one of tradition, order, and old money. The values instilled by Isiah have evolved over the centuries, blending with the customs of nobility to create a powerful and enduring legacy. 

Today, the Wellingtons are seen as both benefactors and rulers, their history a testament to the complex interplay of generosity, power, and tradition that defines their legacy.
