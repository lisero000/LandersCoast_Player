> [!tldr] Short Version
Lady Siaculas Wellington, architect of the Device that felled Keford under the guise of House Mordain was originally known as Lady Amara Wellington. After faking her death and arriving back into the Wellington family by fooling the current family head: [[Lord Eiling Wellington]] as a Xiu'en (overseas country) wealthy diplomat, Lady Siaculas is back into the fold, now controlling Keyford from the shadows using her new husband as her mouthpiece and right hand. With the Accord (council), a council of the most powerful houses (Alderbrook, Stormweaver, Argentwind and Wellington) losing strength as Keyford matures and her goals of lichdom nearing completion,

#### History
##### Background
Before she became Lady Siaculas Wellington, she was known as Lady Isabella Candlebright, a woman from the culturally rich and superstitious town of Vardarok. Vardarok, nestled by the Teniyev Forest, was known for its traditional crafts, music, and strong superstitions about magic and the supernatural.
##### The Scandal in Vardarok
Lady Isabella Candlebright's early life was marked by her secret dabbling in necromancy, an art forbidden in Vardarok. Desperate to gain more power and wealth, Isabella decided to eliminate her family, whom she viewed as obstacles to her ambitions. In a cold-blooded act, she murdered them under the cover of night, making it look like a tragic accident caused by a fire.

However, her dark secrets did not remain hidden for long. Suspicion grew as whispers spread through the town, and Isabella was eventually discovered performing a necromantic ritual by Tomas Belyakov. The town, led by the zealous elder Grigoriy Kamensky, erupted in outrage. Isabella fled Vardarok, leaving behind a trail of chaos and blood.
##### Rebirth as Siaculas Chu
On the run, Isabella encountered Riley Welynton, a nobleman who became enamoured with her. Riley, captivated by Isabella's charm and intellect, decided to help her escape her past. Together, they concocted a plan to present her as a Xiu’en diplomat. Riley arranged for her transformation into Siaculas Chu, a wealthy and mysterious envoy from the distant land of Xiu’en.

> [!NOTE] Candlebright from Vardarok
> Upon investigating historical records, you find mentions of a powerful figure named "Izabela Svetlana" from Vardarok, aligning with Lady Siaculas Wellington's characteristics. A linguistic analysis reveals that "Candlebright" is a mistranslation, as "Svetlana" means "light" or "bright" in Slavic languages. The crest and symbols associated with "Isabella Candlebright" feature Vardarok motifs, indicating "Svetlana" as the correct name. Eyewitness accounts and local scholars consistently refer to "Izabela Svetlana," confirming that "Isabella Candlebright" is an anglicized version of her true Slavic name.

Riley introduced her to society as an exotic and knowledgeable diplomat, carefully orchestrating her entry into Keyford’s elite circles.
###### Murder of Witnesses:
