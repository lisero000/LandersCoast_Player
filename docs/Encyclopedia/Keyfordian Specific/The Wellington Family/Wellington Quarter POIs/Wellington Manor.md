title: "Wellington Manor"
---

The Wellington Manor stands as a testament to old money and tradition within Keyford, characterized by its sprawling, meticulously landscaped grounds and the stately home itself, which is built in a neoclassical architectural style with imposing columns and expansive windows. The manor is not just a residence but a symbol of the power and history of [[House Wellington]], often hosting balls and political gatherings.

#### The Aether Suite
A guest room situated on the second level of the Wellington Manor, the Aether suite is a versatile room for diplomats, guests and individuals with dubious goals to the Wellingons. The suite is illuminated with gorgeous brass magical sconces, surrounded by floor to ceiling bookshelves filled with a number of novels, Encyclopedia and tales from various Wellingtons across history. A four-poster bed is segregated from this one-room, open plan suite and a single writing desk contains a lockable and unlockable drawer. Lord Gorad is known to include old copies of notes or writings from Lord Eiling with minor importance within the locked drawer to test the honesty and integrity of the room's occupants. 

A fully stocked bar, consistent with every Wellington living room is situated behind a sunken lounge, replete with plush carpets and circular lounges surrounding a central fireplace. A small kitchenette is provided with modest non-perishable supplies for occupants with a taste for their own cooked meals. 

A truly lavish "home away from home" for guests of the Wellingtons.
