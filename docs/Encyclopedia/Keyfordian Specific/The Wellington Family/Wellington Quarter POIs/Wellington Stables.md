_Equestrian Center, Master Horace Wellington_ 
Offering the finest in equine accommodations and care, Wellington Stables is known for its champion bloodline horses and superior training facilities. The stables resemble a grand manor, with ample space and luxurious care for the animals. Patrons can purchase horses or pay for riding lessons and equestrian events, with prices starting at 200 gp for a basic steed.


What isn't commonly known is that Wellington Stables stands on the grounds of an ancient battleground, where a pivotal battle was fought centuries ago. This battle was between the original settlers of Landers' Coast and a marauding band of sea raiders. The settlers, vastly outnumbered, made their last stand on the very land where the stables now lie.
