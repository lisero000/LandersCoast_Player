This gallery showcases a vast collection of paintings, sculptures, and artefacts from Keyford and beyond, some dating back hundreds of years. The building itself is a piece of art, with elegant marble floors and walls lined with golden trim. Exhibitions rotate quarterly, highlighting both contemporary artists and revered masters. Entry is free, but special exhibitions may cost up to 5 gp for admission.
