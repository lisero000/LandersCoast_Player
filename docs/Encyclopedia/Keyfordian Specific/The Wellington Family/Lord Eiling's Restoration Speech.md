Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed members of The Accord, and all citizens of Keyford,

We observe today not just a decision regarding the Kefordian Crater, but a moment of reflection and resolve for our shared history and future. The issue before us—whether to restore the crater to its natural state or preserve it as a memorial—reflects the core of our values as a community.

We are all too aware of the scars left by The Device, scars that mar our land and weigh heavily on our hearts. The devastation wrought is not just a tale of sorrow but also a call to action. House Wellington believes that restoring the crater is not merely an act of environmental healing; it is an affirmation of our resilience and our commitment to the future.

Let us consider the benefits of restoration. By employing advanced magical and natural remedies, we can detoxify this land and revive its ecosystem. Imagine the crater not as a barren scar but as a thriving landscape, a testament to our ability to overcome even the darkest of times. This restoration could transform a symbol of devastation into one of hope and renewal.

In your hands, my fellow citizens, more than in mine, will rest the final success or failure of our course. For as long as this community is vibrant and alive, so too will our land reflect that vitality. To let the land lie fallow is to let a wound fester. We propose a balanced approach: restore the land and incorporate elements of memorialisation within this renewed space. Let there be areas within this revived landscape that tell the story of what happened, with monuments that speak of the past but within a setting that is vibrant and alive—a true symbol of Keyford's resilience.

Let every citizen of Keyford know, whether they wish for the crater to remain a memorial site or for it to be restored, that we are dedicated to both honouring our past and healing our land. We must never forget the lessons of that tragic day, yet we must also look forward. Remembering our past and restoring our future are not mutually exclusive goals. We can—and must—achieve both.

So let us begin anew, remembering on both sides that civility is not a sign of weakness, and sincerity is always subject to proof. Let us not be bound by the chains of our past sorrows but be propelled by the promise of restoration and renewal. Let our actions today reflect our dedication to both remembrance and recovery. Let us heal the land and, in doing so, heal ourselves.

Thank you.
