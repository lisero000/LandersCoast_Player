*Large #city, demonym: "Mewoodan"*

The breathtaking city of Mewood is nothing more than a shadow of its former glory. The elves of Mewood took pride in their neutrality from human civilisation and was left relatively to its own devices. The city was a sprawl of plazas and structures naturally blended into a large forest of oversized willow trees reaching over into the Aethel Estuary. The "Rounds" of the city present a series of circular marble platforms on the ground and discs of intricately carved wood above.

After the fall of Keford and the scramble to reassert itself as the main power within Landers' Coast, the elves were taken by surprise at the legions of Litorian Blades at their doorstep. The city's subjugation was swift and decisive leaving the elves with no choice but to succumb to their annexation. Now Mewood is rife with rape, murder and pillaging from its new inhabitants, exploiting the power vacuum currently taking place. Many of its citizens have become puppets to the new Litorian authority.

The silver lining to this swift annexation is that Mewood still maintains some of its historical beauty thanks to members of the Quorum of the Coin investing heavily in post-assimilation restoration projects. The pristine marbled Rounds of the city centre raise a fa√ßade of prosperity and an image of "Business as Usual" to outsiders. Meanwhile the slums beneath the circular platforms below speak volumes of the city's latent present and uncertain future.

Because of this, while the governing body is left to the elves, the city itself is subject to the laws handed down by the Quorum of the Voice. Many laws of which contradictory to elven culture norms. Droves of natives, elven or otherwise flee from the city in droves to seek asylum, taking the perilous journey through the Kefordian wasteland in order to avoid detection by the roaming patrols of Litorians. Many perish, often unprepared or consumed by either the horrifying abominations or the twisted atmosphere. Those that remain within the city itself experience some level of oppression, irrespective of their heritage or demographic. All original Mewood descendants, however, hold some form of hope of their return to restore the city and oust its oppressive overlords.

## The Verdant Protectorate

Now considered puppets to Litorian authority, Mewood's governing body known as the Verdant Protectorate has been truncated significantly, answering to the Litorian Vicarium, Marquessos Palentin. Many of the previous roles of the Verdant Protectorate were removed as being viewed as redundant in the eyes of the Quorum of the Sword or simply merged with the remaining existing roles.

### Arboreal Archon (was: Voice of the Arbor)
The highest-ranking member of the Verdant Protectorate, responsible for overseeing the administration and affairs of the city, ensuring compliance with Litorian directives and policies. The Arboreal Archon is now a bloated role for the single individual responsible for the majority of decisions made within the city.

### Loremaster
Once a title bestowed upon an individual with exceptional knowledge of elven history, culture, and arcane arts. Now they are tasked with merging the history and knowledge between the elves and Litorian customs.

### Sylvan Steward (was: Warden of the Sylvan Glades)
The standing guard of Mewood has mostly been replaced with Litorian mercenaries, removing any potential retaliation from the Sylvan Steward. Once responsible for aiding in the balance of the surrounding lands between the faunal ecosystem, the Sylvan Steward is now a mere caretaker enforcing the few laws of Litorian authority within the city.

### Verdant Herald (was: Weaver of Harmony)
This title is remembered wistfully as an individual who was skilled in foster understanding, and promote harmony a collective patriotism among different the different elven culture. Now, this role is relegated to the official speaker and public communicator for the new Verdant Protectorate, the Verdant Herald arranges proclamations of Litorian authority.

## The Post-Assimilation Restoration Project

Thankfully the annexation was swift and relatively bloodless. There are some structures however, where the resistance was significant enough within the city to damage some of the most well-known landmarks. The restoration of these areas are often undertaken by companies from the Quorum of the Coin with varying motivations from insidiously self-serving to sympathetic to the plight to the Mewoodan elves. Many of these restorations however, leave a touch of Litorian influence on the once "pureblooded" Mewoodan architecture and appearances

### Silverleaf Manor
Led by Solaren & Co., Silverleaf Manor has restored an ancient elven estate located at the heart of Mewood. Once owned by one of the oldest elven families: the Swiftleaf family, the manor has been transformed into a luxurious hotel featuring elven-inspired architecture, intricate silver filigree, and gardens teeming with vibrant flora. The project showcases Solaren & Co.'s influence through its emphasis on opulence and decadence.

### Starfall Pavilion
Spearheaded by the Starlight Consortium, the Starfall Pavilion is an old elven planetarium into a grand entertainment venue inspired by elven celestial themes. The sprawling pavilion now boasts celestial murals adorning its domed ceilings, elegant star-shaped chandeliers, and magical displays that emulate the beauty of a starry night sky. Litorian influences manifest through advanced arcane lighting systems and performances that highlight the Consortium's specialty to technological and artistic prowess.

### Moonshimmer Arcade
Managed by the Silverstride Corporation, the Moonshimmer Arcade was once a garden embedded within one of the largest willows in the area, now a multi-level shopping complex showcasing elven craftsmanship blended with Litorian architecture. The Intricate moon-shaped stained glass windows, ethereal floating walkways, and enchanted mirrors have been repurposed to impress customers with aims to enhance the shopping experience. The project exudes the corporation's vision of blending elven elegance with magical enhancements.

### Sunfire Gardens
Orchestrated by the Sunfire Horticultural Guild, the Sunfire Gardens' restoration is one of the more sympathetic revival Mewood's natural beauty. The immaculately landscaped gardens return exotic flora from Mewood's surrounding regions, intertwining with elven-inspired sculptures and water features. The gardens are carefully designed but reflect a symmetry found only from Litoria's belief in balance and order. Despite this, the Sunfire Gardens have become a tranquil sanctuary amidst the now bustling city.

### Aurora Conservatory
Overseen by the Arcane Nexus Consortium, the Aurora Conservatory's restoration is another sympathetic revival within Mewood. Events are regularly held by the consortium to celebrate the wonders of magic and elven heritage. The conservatory showcases rare and vibrant plants from across Mewood, bathed in an enchanting display of ever-changing lights reminiscent of an aurora.
