 #Metropolis, demonym: " #Litorian"*

The port city of Litoria are the closest link to Landers' Coast history. Much of the city hasn't ever changed since the fall of old Keford. The native Litorians can trace their roots to an old half-elven ancestor or an immigrant dragonborn and because of this, the city is one of tradition and lineage.

More of the wealthier families of Keford avoided the fighting by migrating to Litoria and have since pushed out the locals to form the new Quorum of the Coin.

Over time, the city's infrastructure has finally caught up with the technology of the time. Most tourists visit Litoria for its beautiful arrangement of aqueducts and canals both providing clean water and safe sewage transport out into the ocean. Beyond this, the colourful cast of races and ethnicities both arriving and migrating from distant shores bring unique perspectives, wildly varying entertainment and a constantly evolving lifestyle.

There are three main Quorum within modern Litoria, the Quorum of the Voice, Sword and Coin. Each provide an important overarching aspect of governance within the city and each vie for influence.

# Quorum of the Voice


**The Quorum of the Voice** is the newest power to arise within Litoria. It is filled with over 50 of the most influential people from every significant family within Litoria. Together, a collective of lawmakers, negotiators deal, cahoot and discuss well before the assembly known as "The Floor" takes place which mainly serves as a formalisation point for their respective deals and edicts. The Floor is where most disputes are aired, compromised made and leadership of the city takes place.

***Emblem Description:*** The emblem of the Quorum of the Voice features a stylized lyre, symbolizing harmony, expression, and the power of persuasion. The lyre's strings intertwine with delicate vines and blossoming flowers, representing the diverse voices and ideas that flourish within Litoria. The emblem is set against a backdrop of swirling patterns reminiscent of soundwaves, evoking the resonance and influence of words.

### The Floor
While there are too many members of the Floor to outline completely, there are a few notable individuals:

***Archibald Ravenscroft.*** Esteemed judge and legal scholar, often representing individuals in the most delicate political matters.

***Isabella Duskwood.*** Astute economic advisor and financial expert, often providing recommendations to Litoria's fiscal policies

***Magnus Blackthorn.*** Resolute human ambassador renowned for his unwavering dedication to diplomacy, seeking peaceful resolutions to conflicts and closely involved in the Mewoodan annexation

# Quorum of the Sword

The Quorum of the Sword is the main policing force, enforcing the laws of the Quorum of the Voice. Known as Blades, these highly elite warriors have a rigid way of life training in warfare from negotiation, leadership, subterfuge and logistics. Those worthy of its highest honours are given the title Blademaster, able to fill all three roles of assassin, soldier and strategist.

While the Blademaster is currently only given to 3 individuals within the Quorum of the Sword, the governance and direction is delegated further to a Shadowdancer (subterfuge), a Steelheart (leadership), a Swordsworn (negotiation) and a Swiftblade (logistics).

***Emblem Description:*** The emblem of the Quorum of the Sword portrays a pair of crossed rapiers, embodying precision, skill, and the defense of justice. The rapiers are entwined with ethereal wisps of energy, symbolizing the discipline and mastery of the Blademasters. At the center of the emblem, a focal point emerges, depicting an eye with a single tear, signifying the sacrifice and vigilance required to protect Litoria.

# Quorum of the Coin

The Quorum of the Coin is a conglomerate of merchants, traders and producers who facilitate trade within Litoria. The Coin is the lifeblood of Litoria and arguably the most influential. To this day, despite the name change and the laws of the Voice, the Coin still strongly imposes a plutocratic form of governance and it shows. Those with the most coin within Litoria have the ability to steal, cheat and even murder without significant consequence. A pattern sought to be rooted out by the Voice and the Sword.

Emblem Description: The emblem of the Quorum of the Coin showcases a circular motif featuring a cluster of interconnected gears, representing the intricate machinery of trade and prosperity. Within the gears, various symbols of commerce, such as a merchant's scale, a ship, and a bag of coins, are subtly integrated. Surrounding the gears, a laurel wreath signifies both the fruits of successful trade and the ambition for continuous growth.

These emblems maintain a circular shape to denote unity and solidarity among the Quorums, but each incorporates distinct symbols that reflect the essence of their respective governing bodies.

|---|---|
|Casting Time<br><br>1 minute<br><br>Components<br><br>V,S,M<br><br>(at least 5 elementals  <br>within 100 ft of the caster)|Range/Area<br><br>100 ft.<br><br>Duration<br><br>Until Dispelled|

At the completion of this spell, each creature you target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw. Each creature that fails this save is dissipated, transferring their energies into a barrier which can absorb all damage in a 100 ft. radius equal to the sum of the hit points of each creature dissipated. The barrier has AC 0 and prevents any spell or effect from penetrating unless chosen by the caster. You may lower this barrier temporarily and raise it back up at any time (no action required).
