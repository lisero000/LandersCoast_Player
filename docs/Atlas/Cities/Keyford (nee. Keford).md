*Large #city, demonym: " #Keyfordian "*

South of the original site founded by Gregory Landers after a war between the two most influential Houses left the original site a magically charged wasteland (see The Device), the newest city of Landers' Coast lies wedged between the Litorian Forest and the Rockhold Range. New generations of human noble families have now run the city of Keyford for centuries. Tumultuous alliances since the ages of war have paved the way for prosperous technological and magical advancements. Since its relocation, Keyford's population has thrived under The Accord and is now one of the pinnacles of civilisation within Landers' Coast.

Keyford is a beautiful sprawl that spans from the mouth of the Rockhold River to well into the Farnhallow Fields. The farms of the city stretch out well into these Plains run by the Accord itself to protect the main source of food for the city and neighbouring Litoria. The city is dissected by a complex system of roadways ruled by a prominent named house creating unique districts with varied architecture and culture as each district reflects its ruling house and its views.

While each district is governed by its ruling house, each house submits to the laws enacted and enforced by the Accord. Each ruling house isn't necessarily determined by blood or lineage, but association and respect. To be part of someone's house is to be known all across Keyford's lands.

Most of the population within Keyford are human, however as a result of immigration, refuge and asylum and natural shifts in demographics, Keyford is home to a collective smattering of races both considered common and uncommon alike.

As a result of a mixed heritage and blended culture across the city, all religions are mostly accepted with the exception of worship of commonly known fallen gods. Multiple temples to the gods can be located all throughout the city. The most prominent however is the church of [[The Lightbringer]], his tenets commonly revered by commoners and nobles alike.

# The Keyford Militia

After the destruction of Old Keford, the Keyford Militia were born from the survivors of the tragedy.

Believing themselves nothing more than militia, the humans don't wish to recreate the mistakes of the heavy-handed Kefordian Armed Forces.

The Militia is a collection of misfits, reformed bandits and volunteers from all walks of life advancement is determined by merit and referential power. The one who would be considered a natural inherent leader would be Fabian Oscuro: a charismatic, ruggedly handsome male human fighter who holds a love for people and the city.

Despite its disorganisation, the instinct and natural talent of most militia members makes up the difference. Whenever a significant threat comes to Keyford, the competitive and reckless smattering of individuals becomes a collection of versatile teams.

# The Device

The destruction of the old city of Keford is an event most denizens of Landers’ Coast can remember. It was the result of a long-standing feud between two influential houses within the city, which culminated in the use of a magical artefact known only as “The Device”. Studies by archaeologists and magical academics are of the understanding that this bomb not only absorbed ambient magic, but also drew in energy that bound the immediate ethereal plane. This device's design was lost along with its progenitors upon its activation and subsequent annihilation. With its destructive power, The Device left Keford in ruins, wiping out much of the city and its population. The aftermath of the explosion was devastating, leaving behind what is now known as [[The Kefordian Crater]]. A permanently corrupted magical ley line causes the surrounding area to still be inhospitable to any living creature. Magical monstrosities and spirits of the victims aimlessly wander the crater. The recreation of such a device or similar has been also banned by divinity itself.

The effects of the fall of Keford were felt throughout the peninsula of Landers' Coast. The loss of such a significant city had a ripple effect on the economy, with the disruption of trade routes and the loss of a major source of food and resources. The political landscape was also greatly impacted, as the balance of power shifted toward the mercantile Litoria. The void left by the city's destruction resulted in the subjugation of the peaceful elves of [[Mewood]].

Overall, the fall of Keford was a tragic event that had a significant impact on the Landers' Coast. Its effects were felt for years to come, with the loss of life, economic disruption, political instability, and environmental damage are considered a new era in the history of Landers’ Coast, designating the year’s date be succeeded by the initials ‘FK’.


# The Accord

The Accord holds two meanings within Keyford.

Firstly, the Accord refers to the deal struck by the prominent houses of Keyford to avoid the mutually assured destruction from conflict that scarred the land of the old city. The Accord is detailed on a unilateral agreement setting out rules of engagement, conflict resolution through dialogue and negotiation as well as determining the overarching methods of governance of Keyford as a whole.

The second meaning of the Accord is "The Accord", an amalgamation of both armed forces and legislators submitted by each of the prominent houses to keep the peace and enforce laws created by the agreement. Each participating house is required to submit between 15-25% of its standing guard as well as its eldest and youngest eligible family members as representatives on what is known as the legislative stage.
# Keyfordian Culture
In the wake of the cataclysmic fall of Keford, the city of Keyford emerged as a cultural and economic fulcrum within the Landers' Coast. The society that developed in the shadow of such a disaster is a tapestry woven from threads of tradition, innovation, resilience and a wary scepticism of technology.

# Key Houses
### Relationships Between the Main Houses of Keyford

**Wellington:**

- **Argentwind:** "The Argentwinds' constant manoeuvring in trade deals speaks to their cunning, yet their reluctance to take a firm stance leaves us questioning their loyalty. They are like shadows, always present but rarely seen."
- **Alderbrook:** "Alderbrooks' generosity is admirable, yet their fixation on Elven matters can be a distraction. They pour their hearts into the commonfolk, a virtue we respect, but they must remember we govern a diverse populace."
- **Stormweaver:** "The Stormweavers' breakneck pace in pursuing innovation is reckless. Their disregard for established protocols in favour of change is a recipe for chaos. They could benefit from a touch of decorum and patience."

**Argentwind:**

- **Wellington:** "The Wellingtons' obsession with formality and tradition feels outdated. While their ceremonies are grand, they seem more focused on maintaining appearances than on addressing the real issues at hand."
- **Alderbrook:** "The Alderbrooks' dedication to the commonfolk is both heartwarming and naive. Their generosity is commendable, but it often comes at the cost of political pragmatism. Their Elven priorities can cloud their judgment."
- **Stormweaver:** "The Stormweavers' relentless push for progress is both exhilarating and terrifying. Their innovative spirit is unmatched, but their impulsiveness can lead to unforeseen consequences. They are visionaries, but sometimes vision needs restraint."

**Alderbrook:**

- **Wellington:** "The Wellingtons' focus on ceremony and tradition can be stifling. While they bring a sense of stability, their rigidity often prevents them from seeing the needs of the commonfolk. Their propriety is both a strength and a weakness."
- **Argentwind:** "The Argentwinds' subtlety in negotiations is impressive, yet their tendency to stay in the background makes them hard to trust. They are skilled diplomats, but their aloofness can be mistaken for indifference."
- **Stormweaver:** "The Stormweavers' enthusiasm for change is invigorating, yet their methods can be too hasty. Their innovations bring much-needed advancements, but they sometimes overlook the importance of community and tradition."

**Stormweaver:**

- **Wellington:** "The Wellingtons' adherence to tradition feels like a shackle in a world that demands progress. Their ceremonies and protocols are relics of a bygone era. We need action, not pageantry."
- **Argentwind:** "The Argentwinds' expertise in trade and subtle politics is impressive, yet their passive stance can be frustrating. They navigate the complexities of statecraft with ease, but their reluctance to commit can hinder progress."
- **Alderbrook:** "The Alderbrooks' deep roots in Elven culture and their generosity towards the commonfolk are commendable. However, their priorities can sometimes seem misplaced when rapid innovation is needed. Their heart is in the right place, even if their methods are not."
