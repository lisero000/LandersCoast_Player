Mudhaven is a bustling city located in the heart of the Hissing Vale Desert in Landers' Coast. The city is mostly inhabited by goblins, although a few other races can be found living within its walls. The city got its name from the thick, muddy soil found in the area, which is perfect for growing crops and sustaining life in the otherwise barren desert.

The goblins of Mudhaven are primarily divided into two factions: the Mudbrutes and the Sandscorchers. The Mudbrutes are known for their brutish nature and physical strength, while the Sandscorchers are known for their cunning and resourcefulness in navigating the harsh desert terrain. The two factions are often at odds with each other, but they are united in their devotion to Mudhaven and its survival. A leading representative from each of these two factions come together at a regular basis to determine the decrees of the city. A representative from the Mudbrutes often is selected from a strong chieftain, while a Sandscorcher leader is determined by the goblin who has travelled the furthest distance across the Hissing Vale in their life.

The human population in Mudhaven is made up of traders and merchants who are drawn to the city for its valuable exports, such as exotic spices, rare minerals, and precious gems. Half-elves and tieflings are also common in Mudhaven, often working as traders, merchants, or mercenaries.

Mudhaven's main export is its crops, which are grown using a unique system of underground irrigation tunnels that tap into the water table below the desert. The goblins have also recently begun exporting a rare mineral found in the nearby hills, which they have discovered has magical properties.

The rare mineral found in the nearby hills of Mudhaven is called "Sunstone" named after its unique light-reflecting properties and holds its luminance for days when left in the sun for long enough. Sunstone is used to craft weapons and armour with fire damage and resistance respectively, as well as powering most of the night illumination within Mudhaven. The mineral is also sought after by traders and adventurers who travel to the city, as it can fetch a high price in the markets of the surrounding regions.

#### The Great Goblin Race
Every year, Mudhaven hosts the renowned Great Goblin Race, a grand event that attracts participants from all corners of the world. The race takes place in the vast expanse of the Hissing Vale Desert, with goblins and other races competing in a thrilling and treacherous obstacle course that tests their agility, endurance, and strategic thinking. The course features unique challenges such as sandstorms, hidden traps, and mysterious illusions. The Great Goblin Race has become a legendary event, showcasing Mudhaven's adventurous spirit and their ability to turn the harsh desert environment into an exciting and unforgettable competition.

#### The Sandsong Colossus:
Standing tall in the centre of Mudhaven, the Sandsong Colossus is a colossal statue carved entirely out of the sandy desert terrain. It depicts a mythical creature, half-goblin and half-sand elemental, with outstretched arms that seem to blend seamlessly with the shifting dunes. What makes this statue truly extraordinary is that it comes to life during special celestial events, such as solar eclipses or meteor showers. The Sandsong Colossus emanates a mesmerizing melody, a haunting and enchanting song that resonates throughout the city, filling the hearts of those who hear it with wonder and awe. It is believed to be a manifestation of the desert's spirit and a guardian of Mudhaven, offering protection and inspiration to its inhabitants.
