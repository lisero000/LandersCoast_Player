*Large #city city, demonym: "Rockholder"*

Rockhold Keep is an ancient dwarven city that is nestled deep within the Rockhold Range in Landers' Coast. It is a sprawling network of tunnels, caverns, and vast halls that extend deep beneath the earth. The city is built around a massive underground lake in a crescent shape that is fed by underground rivers and streams. The lake provides fresh water and fish for the inhabitants of the city.

The city is divided into four sections, each occupying a quadrant of the crescent. The northern quadrant is the residential district, where the majority of the dwarves live. The southern quadrant is the industrial district, where the forges and workshops are located. The western quadrant is the commercial district, with shops and markets lining the streets. The eastern quadrant is the cultural district, with theaters, art galleries, and other cultural institutions.

A wide central avenue runs the length of the city, with smaller roads and alleyways branching off of it. A system of canals runs parts from the central lake and extends well into the city's districts, providing transportation with bridges spanning the canals

At the very center of the crescent is a large public square, where festivals and celebrations are held. It is also where the city's governing council meets and makes decisions for the city.

Rockhold Keep is governed by a council of elder dwarves, known as the Stonefathers. These council members are chosen based on their experience, wisdom, and leadership abilities, and are responsible for making decisions that affect the entire city, as well as maintaining its traditions and culture. The Stonefathers also oversee the various guilds and clans within the city, and act as advisors to the current ruler of the city, the High King. The current Stonefathers are held in high regard by the dwarves of Rockhold Keep, and their decisions are respected and followed by the citizens.

Despite being an ancient city, Rockhold Keep is not isolated from the rest of the world. The dwarves are the only traders able to give Litorians a run for their money. They frequently interact with the other civilizations and are known for their love of music, ale, and feasting, and their hospitality is legendary.

Reaching Rockhold Keep by land is treacherous at best, one would need to navigate through the terrain of the Rockhold Range. The most common route is to take the Stonehammer Pass from the eastern side of the range, which winds through dark shadowed cliffs and rocky slopes before eventually leading to the gates of Rockhold Keep.

For those who prefer a more challenging and adventurous route, the Whispering Path offers an alternative, but more dangerous, option. The path is shrouded in mystery, with whispers of strange magic and supernatural creatures lurking in the shadows. The Whispering Path can be accessed by taking the Longhorn Trail to the north, before turning west at the Broken Axe Junction.

Most traders, however take the sea path leading to the Drogbar River. This river descends downward toward the Great Lake found at the heart of the city. Upon their exit, they are assisted by the Ironwater Union who maintain a series of locks to guide them back out to the Despot's Cove.

The quietest Religious District, where the dwarves come to worship their gods enforce a strict noise policy. The streets snake up and down the quadrant and the buildings of mostly wood and visitors are required to remain shoeless to minimise noise from foot traffic. Temples and shrines dedicated to each of the dwarven gods can be found here, and priests and priestesses can often be seen going about their daily routines. The Religious District is also home to the High Temple of Thuranm, the most important and largest temple in all of Rockhold Keep.

The dwarves of Rockhold Keep are known throughout the land for their masterful brewing skills. Their ales and beers are often described as rich, bold, and complex, with a depth of flavor that is unparalleled.

One of their most famous beers is called "Stonefire Stout." This dark, velvety brew has a thick, creamy head and is made from a blend of roasted malts that give it a complex, smoky flavor with notes of dark chocolate and coffee. It has a slightly bitter finish that leaves a pleasant, lingering aftertaste.

Another famous beer from Rockhold Keep is called "Iron Ale." This amber-colored ale has a smooth, malty flavor with hints of caramel and a slightly bitter finish. It's brewed with a special strain of hops that are grown only in the high-altitude valleys of the Rockhold Range, which give it a unique, earthy flavor that can't be found anywhere else.

In addition to these famous brews, the dwarves of Rockhold Keep are also known for their meads and ciders, which are made from locally sourced honey and apples. These drinks are often described as sweet and refreshing, with a subtle tang that balances out the sweetness.

Overall, the brewing traditions of Rockhold Keep are a point of pride for the dwarves who call it home, and their beers and ales are coveted by traders and travellers throughout Landers' Coast.
