*Large #city, demonym: "Camorian"*

A city built from Necessity, the frontier city of Camor is home to a city of misfits, refugees and vagrants. Known as the "City of Opportunity" Camor is home to the Heroes' Guild. A neutral, passive organisation built on the autonomy of its members to serve the interests of the greater Landers' Coast.

Many inhabitants of Camor consist of survivors from the fall of Keford, Litorian deserters, [[Mewood]] refugees and most recently, Rockhold aspirants. While much divides the city's inhabitants, a relative peace is maintained for fear of invasion by their original national powers along with the charismatic musings of Henry Amew, the fourth descendant of the original founder. Some believe however that Henry is nothing more than a figurehead for the true leader of the city: Jorin Greymantle.

As a result of the city's focus on autonomy, much of the city is left to its own devices. Trade flourishes as industries are created, consumed, amalgamated and diverge to service the ever-changing needs of the current adventurers. Crime itself, while rampant, is quickly addressed as ambitious heroes seek to make a name for themselves before venturing out across Landers' Coast. Negotiations between the city led by Henry, the guild led by Jorin and certain service people looking to make a coin create the basic infrastructure that supports the city.

The city itself is quite a smattering of disorganised districts arranged by function. Roadways are sometimes poorly maintained, used by civilians and low-level adventurers. These are only addressed once their traffic increases to notorious individuals who service them for their own benefit.  Over time, the city's networks are barely recognisable. Similarly, the most astute business owners use Camor as a "proving ground" to test new business ideas. The volatility of its economy, driven heavily by demand result in stores lasting months before either closing or moving out to safer areas. The only prominent store servicing adventurers to break this pattern has been "Scrappy's Superb Souk", expanding to a massive compound to sell to all adventurers.
