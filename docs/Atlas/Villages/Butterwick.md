 #Village *, demonym: "Butterwickian"*

Butterwick is a quaint village with a population of 473, nestled in the fertile lands just south of the Lander's Hills and a stone's throw from the lush edges of the Miredeep Sea. The village is famously known for its rich dairy produce, especially its creamy butter, which is sought after by gourmets across the land.

Despite its small size, Butterwick has an air of antiquity about it. The village's age is most notable in the dilapidated chapel of Thuranm, now almost one with nature as moss claims its stones and time weathers its walls. The chapel stands as a solemn reminder of the village's endurance, having witnessed the distant destruction of Keyford.

### Butterwick POIs

- **Ferrous Pond** – A serene pond on the outskirts of the village, notable for its oddly tinged waters, said to be rich in minerals. It's a popular spot for quiet contemplation.
- **The Tender Night’s Rest** – The village's central hub, this inn and tavern is known for its homely atmosphere and hearty meals, featuring, of course, the famed Butterwick butter.
- **Chapel of Thuranm** – Though now in disrepair, this chapel serves as a historical marker, gradually becoming part of the land as nature reclaims it, its aged stones covered in vibrant green moss.

### Notable Characteristics

- **The Gnome Community** – Butterwick is predominantly inhabited by retired gnomes who have spent their lives perfecting the art of butter churning, passing down family recipes that are a closely guarded secret.
- **Witness to History** – The older generations of Butterwickians often recount the tales of Keyford's fall, ensuring that the memory remains alive in the collective consciousness of the village.
- **A Magic-Sparse Region** – In this area, the weave of magic is thin. Spellcasting and enchantments are so rare that the concept of magic is almost mythic to Butterwick's inhabitants.

Butterwick's charm lies in its simplicity and its pace of life that has remained unchanged for generations. It's a place where the past is always present, and the future moves at the leisurely pace of a butter churn.
