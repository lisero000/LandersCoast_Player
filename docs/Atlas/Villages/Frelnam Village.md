#Hamlet, fief of #Camor, demonym: " #Frelnamite"

Frelnam is a small hamlet that sits between the borders of the Ashgrove and the Hissing Vale. It struggles between three Biomes of dangers from the brigands of the south, fire elementals to the east and marauders and lamias to the north.

Despite this, the elvish-orcish margrave Teleran Ko'gel is desperate to make this a hub for adventurers travelling further out. As a retired adventurer himself, Teleran often picks up his old elvish waraxe to protect the settlement he created and often seeks aid from passing members of The Fold.

When the town isn't under some form of attack by monstrous entities, Frelnam is quite the appealing hamlet. Wooden palisades and trenches funnel entrants into a northern and southern bridge. The trenches creating a dry moat, almost elevating the town into a platform. The buildings here are a mishmash of cultural architecture with Teleran's suggestions bearing down on every denizen.

A collection of ambitious individuals make up Frelnam's population. Consisting of mostly traders and crafters looking to settle into a town despite the dangers surrounding it.

 Occasionally the warm embers of the Ashgrove reach the cold breezes coming from the Jade Forest to create a phenomenon known as the Mistveil. This often brings different and unique monstrosities to the town of which many take up the opportunity to attract guild members to keep them safe.
