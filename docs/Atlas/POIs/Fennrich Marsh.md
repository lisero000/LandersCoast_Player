title: "Fennrich Marsh"

Blue Flames of Fennrich Marsh. These ethereal flames are said to appear on foggy nights, casting an eerie glow over the marshlands. Legends among local adventurers and scholars suggest that the flames are the lost spirits of ancient druids who once made the marsh their home. These spirits are believed to guide lost travellers to safety, away from the treacherous quicksand and hidden waterways. However, approaching the flames is advised against, as they occasionally wander near dangerous areas, leading the unwary into peril rather than safety. Some more mystical theories propose that the Blue Flames are a manifestation of the marsh itself, protecting its secrets and deterring the overly curious.
