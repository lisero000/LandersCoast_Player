Beorg Bay is a relatively makeshift area that has become [[Camor]]'s main landing bay for vessels arriving by sea. Beorg Bay is a large horseshoe-shaped beach with a series of guard tents and a single wooden guard tower. Paths have been naturally created from consistent travel from voyagers of multiple vessels over the years.
